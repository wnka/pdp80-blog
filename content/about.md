Hi, my name is Phil Piwonka and I live in Seattle, WA with my [wife](https://kristawelch.com) and two cats.

Why **pdp80**? It's my initials (**PDP**) plus the year I was born (19**80**). Pretty creative. Plus it sounds like the [PDP-8/e minicomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8/E), which is fairly [stylish](/images/pdp8e.jpg). I'm not old enough to have ever used one of those though.

On other social media / sites I use the handle **wnka**, which is my last name transformed into [four letter radio station call letters](https://www.primermagazine.com/2010/field-manual/know-it-all-w’s-and-k’s-the-history-of-radio-and-television-call-letters).
