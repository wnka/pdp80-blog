Whatever I want it to be for!

But more seriously, I want to write random stuff and tinker with web technologies. I’ve learned a lot about CSS and how folks deploy web apps by tinkering with stuff like this. I’m someone who learns best by doing, so a lot of this site is that. 

Also though I want to write more and just share stuff that I think is cool and fun.

I want this site to be as minimal and small as possible. There are no analytics trackers here, no cookies, no JavaScript. I wish more of the internet was just text on a background that didn’t pull any shenanigans when you scroll. I don’t want to scroll past someone’s bio or newsletter signup form to get to content. If I like what I read then I might want to know more.
