Whatever I want it to be for!

But more seriously, I want to write random stuff and tinker with web technologies. I’ve learned a lot about CSS and how folks deploy web apps by tinkering with this site. I’m someone who learns best by doing, so a lot of this site is that.

Writing about things is a good way to focus my thoughts, so in 2025 I want to write more on here about technical topics and little projects I work on. I also want to just share stuff that I think is cool and fun.
