Now that I'm an arcade cabinet owner (squeeee!) I am thinking about what PCBs to buy.  While I'd like some Cave/Raizing/Taito stuff, I figured I'd start with something common and nostalgic: [1943](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943:_The_Battle_of_Midway)

The PCB is actually two boards connected with ribbon cables.  It's awesomely large.

I played this game a lot when I was younger. I had (and beat) the [NES version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK5CJ-bDoqU) and played it in the arcade as well.

The wonderful thing about 1943 was that I could exploit the fact that my dad was really into World War II.  He still is, however now I have my own money so I don't need to leverage his interests to get him to buy video games.  Back then, I needed all the help I could get to convince him to buy a game, and [P-38s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-38_Lightning) helped a _lot_.

So he bought us the game, my brother and I would play it, and while we dodged bullets he'd try to turn it into a history lesson.  He'd try to tell us about [The Battle of Midway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway) and [Richard Bong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bong) and we'd sit there with our mouths open staring at the screen.  However, apparently it did rub off somewhat because I know enough to name drop Richard Bong.

There are some great memories there, plus it's a good game and can be easily had for a reasonable price.

Let the collecting begin...
