Speaking of the Akira anime, the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing. The group that made it is [Geinoh Yamashirogumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geinoh_Yamashirogumi), and the album they made before the Akira soundtrack is 'Ecophony Rinne' and it's good. The [whole album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvm2PUgP9_s) is worth a listen, but the last track ['Reincarnation'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnloUO6r9bs) is incredible.
