Back in 2013, I started a website called [Northwest STG](http://nwstg.com) where I would post videos from STG players in the Seattle area. I did a few posts but the momentum and interest fizzled pretty fast, plus people would just post stuff to their Twitter or whatever.

I pay the hosting bill and own the domain and all that, but I haven't posted anything since 2014 so I'm shutting it down. 

[I'm moving the content to this site and all the posts can be seen here](/categories/nwstg).

Things change, back then we had enough players to justify such a site. We also had weekly meetups at [Full Tilt Ice Cream in Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5) as we were friends with the arcade operator and he set aside a single cabinet for us to rotate STGs on. These are the games we had on that cab:

- Armed Police Batrider
- Raiden Fighters Jet
- Tenkomori Shooting
- RayForce
- Ketsui
- Gunbird 2
- Mushihimesama
- Giga Wing
- Progear
- Ibara Kuro
- Espgaluda II
