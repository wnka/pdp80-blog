I really liked this game and found it to be good and spooky. I beat it last night and got the "In Water" ending.

I've never played a Silent Hill game, but I *have* seen the two Silent Hill movies thanks to my love of goofy movies. Thankfully those movies didn't give the plot of the game away.

I loved the atmosphere and the simplicity of the action. Comparisons in my head to the Resident Evil games and their modern remakes, and [Evil Within 2](/posts/evil-within-2) is included in that bucket, is inevitable. They are just different games though, SH2 being much more puzzle focused and having a more interesting story. The RE remakes are basically action games with jump scares, which I dig and those games do that really well. In SH2 there's no "use these coins to buy yourself more health capacity" or "spend this resource to make it so your gun reloads faster" which I liked. There are 3 guns and they never change, you find ammo and don't need to craft it, and there aren't that many enemy types. It's more about exploring spooky environments and solving puzzles. And when I say "solving puzzles" it's mostly of the variety of "I found this object but it's missing pieces, I gotta find those pieces and then arrange them in the right way, then a door opens and there's a key inside, now I can go somewhere new."

I really liked how the main character doesn't really react to the weirdness around him, he treats it as normal mostly and when weird things happen there's no dialog telling you that it's weird. James doesn't go "holy shit! what the fuck is that?!" When you meet Pyramid Head for the first time, he's just standing on the other side of some bars bathed in red light. There's no cutscene, there's no reaction from James, you just get to see it and be creeped out by it. Compare that to [Until Dawn](/posts/until-down) where characters I didn't like are basically narrating what's happening and freaking out. I got really annoyed by that in Until Dawn, and I didn't really realize that until playing this and seeing the contrast. Until Dawn is basically listening to music with a narrator telling you that was a sweet drum solo. Let me have my own feelings dammit!

The atmosphere, environments, and "music" are amazing. I put "music" in quotes because it's very ambient, not pulse pounding action stuff. Jump scares are fairly rare because of the radio mechanic that tells you weirdos are near.

I'm curious how it compares to the original, but I'll probably just go watch some YouTube videos and get an idea. Maybe I'll play another game in the series... although honestly I'm going to guess they're remake more and I'll just play those.

So do I like it more/less than RE? Who cares, they're different games trying to do different things. I like both. In RE it's super satisfying to shoot a rocket launcher into a cluster of zombies or whatever. They're both great.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

My one beef with the game, which I have to say got me audibly irritated, is that after the big plot reveal that James murdered Mary they should have just ended the game. What annoyed me is that after that you're walking around, there's some voice over and some things unfolding, but then you come across **some ammo** or **a health item** which totally telegraphs that there's going to be more action. **WHY?!?!?!?** You have this emotionally powerful moment and then you walk around and start finding ammo. Just end it! But noooo, this is a video game and you need to have a final battle with a big guts monster. Even worse they could have avoided telegraphing those battles by not having random ammo laying around because in those battles there are tons of item drops in the room! ARRRRGHHHH!

Despite this, or even because of this, I really liked the game. I don't usually get this kind of emotional reaction about *the plot of a video game* which to me is a sign the game did it's job.
