I’ve dealt with lower back pain for probably 15 years. It sucks! I’m recovering from of the worst flare up I’ve ever had, which landed me in the ER unable to move. If I tried to lift my heel off the bed I would get insane pain as my back would completely clench up and spasm. They gave me a bunch of drugs but nothing really helped until they gave me an IV drip of Valium. That caused my back to stop spasming and I was able to slowly walk out of there. 

[Here’s a nice song about Valium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOeuzeNfQ8).

I’m now taking it easy at home and balancing between lying down to rest and “ambulating.”  I wish there was a cool story behind what started this but there isn’t. It just kinda started which is the crappiest part. I’m doing PT and getting back on my feet, essentially I have a weak core and glutes (aka weak gut and weak butt) which causes my back to get overloaded.

It’s pretty miserable and depressing to get into such a state. I gotta get my shit together on this one.
