There's a new [Lord Finesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Finesse) album out: [The SP 1200 Project: Sounds & Frequencies in Technicolor](https://lordfinesse.bandcamp.com/album/the-sp-1200-project-sounds-frequencies-in-technicolor). It's instrumental hip-hop and it's real good. It's the sequel to [The SP 1200 Project: A Re-Awakening](https://lordfinesse.bandcamp.com/album/the-sp-1200-project-a-re-awakening) from 2015 which I really loved so when I saw this was out I bought it no questions asked. Yes, I buy digital music.

The [SP 1200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mu_SP-1200) is a drum machine that was used in a lot of 90's hip-hop and has a unique sound due to it's limitations. These albums pay homage to that machine and era.

Lord Finesse is great, he's been involved in so much good music dating all the way back to [Funky Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Technician) in 1990. What a fella.

**UPDATE March 21 2025:** [There was talk about the album](https://youtu.be/oQ_hw_sUBek?si=TswOQiiBsbQLg2tM) which included a chat between Lord Finesse and Dave Rossum, one of the inventors of the SP-1200. This starts at around 51 mins in to the video and is really great. Lots of mutual respect and admiration between the two. 

**UPDATE March 22 2025:** I forgot to mention that every Saturday at 9am PST, Lord Finesse [live streams DJ sets on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/lordfinesseditc). They're great and family friendly, at least I've found them to be while I'm enjoying them with my daughter.
