There's a new [Lord Finesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Finesse) album out: [The SP 1200 Project: Sounds & Frequencies in Technicolor](https://lordfinesse.bandcamp.com/album/the-sp-1200-project-sounds-frequencies-in-technicolor). It's instrumental hip-hop and it's real good. It's the sequel to [The SP 1200 Project: A Re-Awakening](https://lordfinesse.bandcamp.com/album/the-sp-1200-project-a-re-awakening) from 2015 which I really loved so when I saw this was out I bought it no questions asked. Yes, I buy digital music.

The [SP 1200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mu_SP-1200) is a drum machine that was used in a lot of 90's hip-hop and has a unique sound due to it's limitations. These albums pay homage to that machine and era.

Lord Finesse is great, he's been involved in so much good music dating all the way back to [Funky Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Technician) in 1990. What a fella.
