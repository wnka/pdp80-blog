# Music

- [Nirvana's Nevermind but with the Super Mario 64 soundfont](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtapU5nI6G4) - Genius for the cover art alone. My favorites are "Breed" and "Drain You". The Mario scream at the end of the "Drain You" noise section is fabulous.
- [John Peel Sessions](https://davestrickson.blogspot.com/2020/05/john-peel-sessions.html) - Great resource for a lot of great music. Oddly it's missing this [1983 Session from The Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPAiOLd-0f0) which is top shelf. Two drummers! The version of [Eat Y'self Fitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPAiOLd-0f0&t=1462s) is great: "John Peel picked this song as one of his Desert Island Discs; when Peel had first heard the track – in a session the band recorded in March 1983 – he stated on air that he had fainted and his producer, John Walters, had had to resuscitate him."
- [The Fall - Live on the Tube 1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-6xoh1khg) - Might as well throw this in too.
- [Hildur Guðnadóttir - What's In My Bag?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoeSCNx-fA) - I don't know her work but she discusses a lot of interesting music!

# Gaming
- I'm super hyped for the Resident Evil 4 remake to come out this Friday. Preordered on Steam!
- I kinda want a [Psygnosis T-shirt](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/psygnosis+t-shirts).

# Misc 

- [Knowledge Fight - Meet Captain Mark Richards](https://podbay.fm/p/knowledge-fight/e/1504242710) - A continuation of the goofball that was discussed on [the episode of The Dollop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Ape0zUnT4&t=455s) I mentioned last week. So that guy, while being in jail for murder, got married and is, again while being in jail for murder, is claiming to be a captain in the Secret Space Program. Learn about space raptors and how they're at war with space reptilians.
