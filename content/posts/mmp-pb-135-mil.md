It's been snowing in Seattle which means a lot of sitting indoors, so this weekend I played some [Muchi Muchi Pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muchi_Muchi_Pork!) and streamed it on Twitch. I was able to improve my 1-ALL score from 127,207,710 to 135,255,400.

My current goal is get on the high score table on my PCB, which I got from Japan [back in January 2014](/blog/2014/01/muchi-muchi-pork-pcb/) (weird to think that was *five* years ago) and it has some pretty crazy scores saved on it. For me to even get on the high score table, I would need at least 150 million. Seems doable if I practice and get some of the boss timings down.

Also, I've improved my arcade capture setup which I'll detail in a future post. The sound on this video recorded a little too loud which is why it's a bit distorted, gotta fix that.
