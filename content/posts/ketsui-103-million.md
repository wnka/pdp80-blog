I played some [Ketsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui) today for the first time in about 6 months and streamed it on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/pdp80) for fun. On my 2nd run, I got a new personal best for clearing the first loop and broke 100 million for the first time with a score of 103,939,795.

I think I'll play and stream some more soon. I'll work on improving the audio quality too!
