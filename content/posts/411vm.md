Usually in my life "VM" means "Virtual Machine" but not this time. 411VM was a skateboarding "video magazine" that ran from 1993 to 2005. Some wonderful and amazing person put all the "issues" on [archive.org in a playlist that is available here](https://archive.org/details/411-vm-best-of-411-vol.-7-2001).

Skate videos are what I was under the influence of in the 90s. I owned 411VM Volume 11 (1995) on VHS and I watched that thing over and over and over. I'd watch it before I went skating and get all hyped up and then try tricks and hurt myself.

The pinnacle of my skateboarding ability was doing frontside half cab kickflips. We built some grind rails with PVC pipe and those were fun. The first one we built my dad helped, and when it was done I tried to boardslide it but the new PVC was so slippery I just completely ate shit. My dad stood there as I was on the ground and sarcastically said "Welp, I'm really glad we built this." It just took some getting used to man!

I stopped skating around the time I started college, but it was fun while it lasted. Nowadays I'm old and creaky and any skateboarding I do is in video games.
