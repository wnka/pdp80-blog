I joined [Speedy's E-Bike Rescue](https://joinspeedys.com/), which is like AAA for e-bikes. If you break down or have issues in the Seattle area, they'll come save you and take your bike to your favorite local bike shop. I cruise around a lot with our kiddo on our RadWagon (we recently passed 2,000 miles!) and getting a flat or having some issue would suck so I'm really glad this service exists and am happy to pay for it. The RadWagon is a real beast, it weighs about 100 pounds and changing a flat on it is not trivial since you have to deal with all the e-bike bits to get the wheel off.

If I ever use it I'll write about my experience. I learned about this service from [Best Side Cycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNV75P3QyB8), a YouTube channel that's a great resource for Seattle cyclists.

Happy cycling!
