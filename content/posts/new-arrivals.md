MORE GAMES! I won these on [Yahoo Auctions Japan](http://category.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/list/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E5%9F%BA%E6%9D%BF-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0-%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0-%E3%81%8A%E3%82%82%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83-%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0/2084047782/?fr=auc-prop&tab_ex=commerce&p=%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E5%9F%BA%E6%9D%BF) and used [Rinkya](http://rinkya.com/) for proxy bidding.

## Ibara

![Ibara](/images/ibara.jpg)

My second [Cave SH-3](http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=868) game, I got a good deal on this as it includes PCB, box, instruction strip, POP, and dip switch flyer.

## Volfied

My first [Taito](http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=650) game that I only got because it was so cheap, but its actually a pretty excellent game. Its basically an updated version of [Qix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix), which is a game I really like and this version is a cool update.

## Mars Matrix

[GO PLAY MARS MATRIX](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRhFYV4-pBQ). By [Takumi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takumi_Corporation), this is my first [CPS-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_System_II) game. I played this on Dreamcast a ton and am really glad to have the arcade version.

## Giga Wing

My second [CPS-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_System_II) game, another great horizontal shmup by [Takumi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takumi_Corporation).
