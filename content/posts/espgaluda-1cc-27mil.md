My best score in this game and it's a **ONE CREDIT CLEAR!**

I first got this game back in 2011 and got a 1CC pretty soon after I got it with a score of 27,387,750. I haven't played it much since then, but I recently hooked up all my PCBs to make sure they still work, and settled to play this a bit more. I barely squeaked past that score with this run, and now I have a video of a 1cc run!
