Still got it.

I haven't touched my arcade cabs much recently, I've been a modern gamer and modern games are great!

The new joystick hotness seems to be the ["SANWA JLX-TPML-8YT-SK Adjustable Silent Leaf Microswitch Joystick"](https://focusattack.com/sanwa-jlx-tpml-8yt-sk-adjustable-silent-leaf-microswitch-joystick/) and I wanted to check it out, so I got one for the arcade stick I use with my PC and one for my vertical arcade cab I use for hardcore shmup action. I ordered some other parts like the larger actuators and different gate inserts and messed around with them. I didn't know what these different restrictor gates did, but they're like $3 so I ordered a few to see what the latest in joystick tech is. For shmups I like a "short throw", meaning you don't have to push the joystick far for it to register movement. I messed around a little but landed on the biggest actuator, the microswitches to their most sensitive, and the [GTN-R Square Mod Type I](https://focusattack.com/sanwa-gtn-r-square-mod-type-i-restrictor-gate-insert/) restrictor gate. This sounds like some Import Tuner car guy stuff. 

I mounted the new joystick in the cabinet and tested it. Mushihimesama is what just happened to be in the cab so I start playing Original mode, the easiest mode... and hey, this joystick feels really nice, the GTN-R restrictor gate has little bumps to help you not accidentally slip and hit diagonals. I dig it!

I'm messing around but I make it all the way to stage 4 with only 1 death, so then I start playing a little more seriously and BAM, I clear it on one credit (aka no continues). Pretty rad! I even had one life to spare...

This felt really good, it's always such a rush to 1cc a game. I don't know if it was the joystick, or playing on an arcade cab, or playing on an arcade monitor/CRT, or all of the above, but the game just felt super responsive and good. No input lag and navigating the bullet patterns felt awesome.

My final score was 19,784,044 which isn't great, I think [this]({{<ref mushihimesama-1ccs-at-full-tilt>}}) is my best at 29,313,539. The biggest contributor to your score is the number of lives you have left after you clear so to get the best score you need to beat the game without dying. Trying to do that sounds like no fun, so I think I'll move on and play something else.

I've been slowly making my way through that new Indiana Jones game, it's fun but more like how a movie is fun. With the dust blown off the cab, I played a quick game of [ESP Ra.De.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_Ra.De.) using my [MiSTercade](https://misteraddons.com/products/mistercade-v2-kit-mister-fpga-jamma-arcade-kit) and got to the last stage on 1 credit, which then proceeded to whoop up on me and it took me 4 credits to clear. I've never 1cc'd that game, so I'll give it a shot next.
