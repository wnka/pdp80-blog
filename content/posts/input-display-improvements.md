I did some more work on my [JAMMA input display](/posts/jamma-input-display/) recently and its working really well now. Before I had some issues with stuck inputs and it freezing up, but I upgraded to the 1.0 version of [socket.io](http://socket.io) and now it's rock solid. I also upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 2 which reduced the lag between the inputs and the display.

I've been on pager duty for work this week, which means I need to be near a computer at all times in case something goes wrong. That possibility rules out going for a nice long bike ride this weekend, so instead I added to new feature to my input display: remote control!

You can now click/tap on any of the inputs on the display and they will be remotely triggered. Not super handy, but neat! The idea came about when hanging out with [KevinDDR](http://twitch.tv/kevinddr) while I was teaching him how to play [Ketsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui:_Kizuna_Jigoku_Tachi) and telling him when to bomb to avoid dying. I thought it would be cool to be able to actually do it for him. Someday we'll get together and try it!
