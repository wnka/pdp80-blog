I hadn't listened to this live DJ set that DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist did in ~1999 in a long time, but it's still real good. It's all done using 45s (that's 7-inch 45 RPM records) and has a nice mix of weirdo and funky tracks. [Here it is on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4-iYnZtJcI). What I *didn't* know was that there was a video version as well, which is from a different live performance and that's [also on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HlOo0wwGQo).

I bought a CD of this when it was new at Wax Trax in Colorado and it was a CD-R bootleg. You could see the inkjet lines on the cover, and the CD had one of those inkjetted circular stickers on it. This is the old timey equivalent of the above Youtube links!
