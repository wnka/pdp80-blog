A friend and I watched the new Road House remake. As a big fan of the original Road House from 1989, I figured I'd give share my thoughts.

I like the original better. The new one doesn't have a lot of joy. It tries to be darker, grittier, and show that maybe someone who loves to fight comes from a dark place.

In the 80s one, Dalton is a business man. He has a good job at the start of the movie. Why does he have a good job? Because he's the best damn cooler in the business. What's a 'cooler' exactly? Who knows, it doesn't matter but people know of him far and wide. He gets headhunted to be the cooler for another bar. Why does the other bar need him? "I need the best." He knows what he's worth and demands fair compensation to change jobs. In a world of chaos and conflict, Dalton is a principaled man who [operates by a set of simple rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8aNfg0LBgQ). Tenets if you will. Anyway, the movie has a lot of peak 80s horseshit in it, like a Bigfoot-esque monster truck crushing cars, Sam Elliott, and really silly one liners. "Pain don't hurt" for example, or "you're too stupid to have a good time." I still think of caffeinated and decaf coffee as 'leaded or unleaded' which doesn't really age well since there's no such thing as leaded gasoline anymore.

The remake has Dalton as an mentally unstable and unemployable UFC fighter. He had a UFC fight against someone who was his friend and he *unnecessarily kills him* in the ring, as in he won the fight but couldn't stop beating him. Because of that he's homeless and unemployable. But a bar owner needs help with some toughs, and those toughs are part of some rich guys plan to obtain the land the bar is on so he can build a giant hotel or something. There was just no joy in it for me and Dalton is a bit of a psycho. He kills a bad guy and hauls his body around on ice to try and frame a crooked cop. I... can't get on board with that.

The acting in the remake is decent and I'm sure if the new movie was called something else I'd view it differently, but the original movie is silly and this movie isn't silly. I like my 'tough guy defends bar against goons hired by evil rich guy' movies silly.
