I'm real sad that Steve Albini has passed away. I love a lot of music that guy made or was somehow involved with.

[Here's an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPMNY3roo_Y) with Steve and Ian MacKaye (from Minor Threat/Fugazi) that's a great listen. I don't even know who the interviewer is because they don't really get involved and it's basically just a conversation between Ian and Steve. Highly recommended.
