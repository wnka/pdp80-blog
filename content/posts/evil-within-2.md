I finished this game last night and liked it.

I thought it did a good job of combining Resident Evil 4 style combat with stealth elements. I also liked that ammo was scarce which forced you to be stealthy and do sneaky kills.

I couldn't tell you what the plot is. I'm in a dream world where my daughter is really important for some reason, "the core" of the world.

Why? Who knows, who cares. Video game plots have one direction: shoot your way forward. Big bad guy talking mad shit? Shoot 'em bunch. Do they laugh at how bullets will do nothing to them? Shoot 'em more, eventually it'll start working. Does your wife seems evil with white stuff coming out of her eye sockets? Shoot her until she melts into a big puddle of goo. She'll be ok and emerge from the puddle totally in tact and cured. Her sweater and earrings will be in tact even!

My one complaint is that the end of the game got too easy. I beat the last boss on the first try.

I thought the evil photographer bad guy was pretty neat, but after you defeat him the enemies become pretty standard.

I might play it again on 'new game plus.' There were lots of times when I cleared an area of bad guys only to find there were environmental things like exploding barrels I could have taken advantage of. That kind of stuff is always so satisfying.

Up next: the Until Dawn remaster on PC. I never played the original. It's October, so more spooky games. The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming out soon too, I'm gonna play that too. I haven't played the original of that either.
