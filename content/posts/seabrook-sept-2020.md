We rented a house on the Washington coast at [Seabrook](https://www.seabrookwa.com/) for a few days and spent some time on the beach and in the trees. It was great to get away for a bit and have a change of scene. I was pretty crushed that the cable TV in our rental didn't have the Lifetime channel, so I couldn't catch up on great movies like [HER DEADLY SUGAR DADDY](https://play.mylifetime.com/movies/her-deadly-sugar-daddy/her-deadly-sugar-daddy) or [POOL BOY NIGHTMARE](https://play.mylifetime.com/movies/pool-boy-nightmare). Next time I'll be more diligent.
