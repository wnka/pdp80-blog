In August 2018, I biked **251.8 miles**! Much improvement!

Notable rides:

1. [Seattle-Redmond loop](/blog/2018/08/bike-seattle-redmond/) - 37.6 miles
1. [South Lake Washington loop](/blog/2018/08/south-lake-washington/) - 41.8 miles
1. [West Seattle](/blog/2018/09/west-seattle/) - 24.8 miles

With my back feeling better, it was great to put in longer rides and cover new routes. My goal is to do longer rides on the weekends and make blog posts when I cover a new route.

I also set a new one week mileage record of **111.7 miles**, beating my previous record of 111.2 miles set in July of 2016.

2018 total miles: **898**
