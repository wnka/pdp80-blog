Yesterday a friend and I biked down to check out the new bike lanes that opened on the Seattle Waterfront. They're real nice and it's great to have more bike infrastructure connecting different parts of the city.

We hung out at Pier 62 for a little bit and had coffee, there was a ceremony at 11am and we could see the ribbon they were gonna cut but we didn't stick around for that. Instead we biked north by the Sculpture Garden, through the railyard that runs between Queen Anne and Magnolia, across the Ballard Locks, then on the Burke Gilman trail back to my house.

All in all it was 18.5 miles which is the longest bike ride I've done in a while. We weren't planning on going this far, but we kept extending it since the weather was nice and we were feeling alright. It felt really good to get back on the bike (a non-e-bike that is).
