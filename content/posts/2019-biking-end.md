Happy New Year!

In 2019 I biked **1,903 miles** which crushed my goal of 1,500 miles. I was hoping to hit 2,000 miles but getting sick in the middle of December made that hard.

For 2020 I am setting a goal of 2,000 miles. Now that we have a baby it's going to be hard for me to go on longer rides, however I'm planning on doing a lot more commuting to work by bike. That plus doing Peloton rides can probably get me there. We'll see!
