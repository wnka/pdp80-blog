I recently beat Doom Eternal and have been making my way through the DLC and goddamn I love this game. It doesn't give two shits about story but focuses on being a fun and challenging video game, kinda like shmups/arcade games. There are even 1ups!

It's hard but it's fair and it does such a great job of giving you all the tools you need to get through the battles. If you're low on health then glory kill some dudes. If you're low on ammo then chainsaw something and neon ammo will fly out. If you want armor then use your flamethrower thing and the bad guys on fire will drop armor bits. These things make no sense in the real world, but we're fighting demons here so why be tethered to game mechanics that are realistic. Of course chainsawing a demon in half gives you a ton of ammo, duh. There's that one enemy where you have to wait until it's eyes flash green to hurt it, but when you do it gets stunned and there are literal cartoon stars above it's head and a silly sound effect. That enemy is a pain in the ass but when you defeat one it's glorious.

Too many games don't have fun with their rules like this so you're running around an abandoned town but there's ample ammo laying around. Even in something like The Evil Within where you're in some sort of fake dream world there aren't fun rules, you're still reloading your gun. Not in Doom Eternal! In Doom Eternal your double barrel shotgun has a hook that shoots out and pulls you towards enemies so you can punch them super hard when you get close, and if you have this one power up the hook causes them to catch fire so they spew armor bits when you deal damage. So satisfying.

I watched the preview for the next Doom game, Doom: The Dark Ages and I'll be buying it day one. The style seems a little weird but I'm sure that it will all combine into fun.
