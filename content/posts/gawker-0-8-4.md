A new version of Gawker has been [released](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Download.html)!

You can use 'Check for Updates' from within Gawker to get this new update.

This release fixes desktop recording on OS X Lion.  It also moves the minimum OS requirement up to OS X Snow Leopard.  This means no more support for PowerPC Macs.

The source code for this version is in the git repository and has been tagged "[v0.8.4](http://gawker.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gawker/gawker;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/v.0.8.4)"

Thanks!
