In Jan 2018, I biked 197 miles. This year I've been dedicated to riding my bike to work most days (for some definition of most). It really is the best way for me to get to work, both in terms of time and health/mental benefits. I've got a good routine and gear to handle the rain. Each round trip is 10 miles, so this month I did roughly 20 commutes. Not bad!
