[This video is fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXCVsDFiXA) and incredibly well made. It's quite long at 3h45m, but a lot of it you can skip as it goes through every example of where invisible walls occur in the game. 

I *really* enjoyed it! How these early 3D engines work and the kinds of tradeoffs they had to make is always interesting to me, all kinds of simplifications have to be made to maintain performance which then leads to side effects like these.
