I came across this hilarious Packard Bell TV commercial from 1996. What art!

Reminds me of that Mr. Plow ad from the Simpsons.

I never owned a Packard Bell, but my first "real" job was in 1997 doing phone tech support for them. Up until that point I knew I wanted to do something with computers, and this job taught me that there are some pretty crappy computer jobs out there. I used some of the money I earned to buy some programming books and developer tools so I could teach myself programming. My first book was [Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days](https://www.amazon.com/One-Hour-Sams-Teach-Yourself/dp/0789757745/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=TD8QDZ9B9WJF1ESVJE6S) which took me way longer than 21 days. I stuck with it though and decided to study Computer Science in college, which has enabled me to have a non-crappy computer job.
