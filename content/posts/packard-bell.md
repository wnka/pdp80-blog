Look at this hilarious Packard Bell TV commercial from 1996.

Reminds me of that arty Mr. Plow ad from the Simpsons.

My first "real" job was in 1997 doing phone tech support for Packard Bell. I was in high school and up until this point I figured knowing how to edit a config.sys and autoexec.bat would take me far in life, but that job motivated me to step it up and teach myself programming and study computer science.
