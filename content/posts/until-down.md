Do you like holding up on your controller for extended periods of time? 

This game is slow, you walk slow, things happen slowly, and the characters are mentally slow. It's a horror movie where you help the participants make bad decisions, so my main goal was to make them all die. Why would you watch a horror movie if no one dies?

My favorite part was the doctor/psychiatrist guy played by [Peter Stormare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stormare), you know him from the Coen Brothers movies like Fargo where he puts Steve Bucemi in a wood chipper or The Big Lebowski where he shouts "**WE CUT OFF YOUR JOHNSON!**" in Jeff Bridges' face. The scenes with him where he's interviewing you were neat, but it felt like that time on the Simpsons when the kids are taking a test about their job interests and the questions are:

> I prefer the smell of:
> 1. Gasoline
> 1. French fries
> 1. Bank customers 

I really made sure to tell the good Doctor that I'm afraid of crows. 

So yea, the characters are cringy and all crazy stereotypes. Over time, I had to really stop thinking that I was playing a game and then I started enjoying it a little bit more. Basically you walk forward, there's a jump scare, and then when you have to actually do something it turns into Dragon's Lair where you do quick time events.

Speaking of Dragon's Lair, I've been borrowing the Amiga version from an old neighbor for 35 years. The disks are in my basement. We're still friends and I asked him if he wanted them back and he laughed and said I could continue to hang onto them.

Back to Until Dawn. I beat it and it didn't take too long, and I saved way more people than I was anticipating. I think only Ashley, Jessica, and Sam died, and Sam only died in the last scene when I couldn't stay still enough. I wouldn't say I liked it, it's barely a game. I looked at some videos online to see if it was worth replaying again, and there are a different endings and stuff but it turns out that most of your decisions don't really matter. All that talk of me fearing crows didn't result in any crow scares. Also if you fail the quick time events it mostly doesn't matter. So that isn't very satisfying. Mike loses some fingers if you fall for a trap but it doesn't matter. There's no like "oh I could climb out of this if only I had all my fingers!" 

It would be interesting if at the end of the game they looked at your decisions and told you something about yourself, like "you're a wuss" or "interesting... only women died in your playthough, an alpha male wouldn't have let that happen" or anything.

So not for me and I won't play through it again. Up next: Silent Hill 2 Remake!
