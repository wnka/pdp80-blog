I cleared the first loop of [the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Ren_Sha_68K), which means I beat stages 1-6 + stage 0 on one credit. I game over'd on the first stage of the second loop (stage 2-1). I've been playing the game a little bit thanks to the new [Sharp X68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000) [core for MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/X68000_MiSTer). This just started off as a casual run, I wasn't swinging for the fences or anything, but this led to me playing conservatively and bombing a lot. The real game changer was that I got better at the 'collect all 3 powerups' trick, which really helps drive up your score, which then helps you get extra lives.
