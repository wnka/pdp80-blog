This blog has a lot of posts about SHMUPS but I haven't played shmups in quite a while, at least with any seriousness. Don't get me wrong, I still love serious shmup action, but after a long day of work and parenting I just don't want to sit and grind out trying to get a 1cc. My daughter is old enough to play games now and she likes Minecraft and the games that are in the PBS Kids app. That PBS Kids app has some good games, there's one that was similar to "The Incredible Machine" which I played the hell out of when I was a kid. We also played through "Donut County" which she had a lot of fun with.

But bhe doesn't want to go for high scores or 1ccs on intense shooting games and that's super ok.

I bought one of those handheld retro gaming devices from Anbernic (who knows what model, their model numbers are the most confusing shit ever) and it's great. On a whim, I started playing "Chrono Trigger" on it because I've always heard that game is great. I own it on Steam since I bought it on sale and added it to my massive pile of games, but playing on a handheld with an emulator where I could save state my way through the game was the way to go.

And I finished it! And it was wonderful!

This is the only RPG I've ever played all the way through but now I'm into it, it just fits the speed of my life and the way to want to relax nowadays. Playing and kiddo needs something? You don't even need to pause the game, just stop moving and it basically pauses itself. Oncall and get paged? Toss the handheld aside and go fix things.

Dragon Quest has been making waves lately with their remasters and I started playing the remaster of part one. My daughter is into maps and dragons and fairies (faeries?) so it's perfect. She helps me remember strategies for the different enemies and we can take our sweet time thanks to the turn based combat. "Hit it with fire, then lightning." She wants to use magic all the time and I explain how MP is a limited resource and we need to conserve it. She doesn't care: hit it with lightning. Then we run out of MP and she starts to understand resource management (a little). Thanks to the autosaving, dying is no big deal at all, we die over and over. She got tired of just watching me so I taught her how to play, so we take turns on the battles.

I also need something to play without her after she goes to bed or whatever, and "Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" just came out so I'm playing that by myself. It's so good. Adventure!

Gotta go! **CLOP clop CLOP clop**
