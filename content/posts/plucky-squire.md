10 out of 10! This game is amazing!

I played this with my daughter (~5) and she loved it, I did all the playing but I read all the dialog to her and asked for her help with the puzzles. I've been trying to play games a little more with her and this was a really wonderful choice.

We read a lot of books, so the format of the story being part of a book was really cute and well executed. When you learn new abilities you get taken to a training area to help you learn the ropes which was great for my daughter, she could practice over and over.

It was just the right length and mixed up the gameplay elements enough to keep it interesting, our favorite part was where you had to sneak past the guards as the mouse Pip and use rhythm to time when to move. My daughter is really into spy stuff and being sneaky so this was great. In fact, she told me the other day that *she is a spy* and so is our cat Tilly. Cool!

This game was very similar to a 2D Zelda game, so the next thing we're going to play together is the new 2D Zelda game [Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/). I'm really glad they made a Zelda game where you actually play *as Zelda* and go on your own epic adventure. We started playing it last night and she's already understanding the puzzles.  I'm guessing that game is longer and it'll take us some more time, hopefully it'll hold her interest.
