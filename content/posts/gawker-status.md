Back in 2005, I wasn't happy at my job and was worried about getting stuck. I wanted to create something that I could point people to and say 'I wrote that! Hire me!' 

The first version of Gawker went live on February 4th, 2006. That's five years ago!  I uploaded it to SourceForge and notified MacUpdate and VersionTracker.  The response that I got was more than I ever imagined, it got featured on websites like [tuaw.com](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/05/01/gawker-record-share-combine-time-lapse-movies-with-an-isight/) and I started getting a lot of e-mails from people that enjoyed using it. I still get e-mails from people that enjoy using it, and this 'fanmail' is so rewarding and so appreciated.

This plan worked and I am now working at a great company. This is the main reason why Gawker development has stagnated.  The other reason is that in 2006 when I stopped focusing on it, I felt that more features to Gawker would be mostly unnecessary.  It does what it claims: it makes time-lapse movies.

That is not to say there aren't improvements that could be made.  Things have changed since 2006: HD video is now commonplace, Mac applications have very different UI styling, and people downloads apps through the App Store. I have thought about this quite a bit and there are plenty of things that could be done to improve Gawker, however I don't have any plans to make any improvements.

I just wanted to say thank you to every single person who ever used Gawker. Cheers!
