[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlKetNSAtE) shows the progression of speedruns for [King's Quest 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I). The amount of optimization and reverse engineering done to get this time down so low is impressive, things like figuring out how the hitboxes work and how you can walk across water.

There's also a prequel to this new video, [King's Quest Speedrunning World Record History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbb2GNDVqFc) if you want more lore.

I never really played KQ1, the first one I ever played was KQ2. [Speedruns for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFnpxPW6wAc) are crazy too!
