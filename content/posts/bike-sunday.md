Today was the first [Bicycle Sunday](https://parkways.seattle.gov/2019/01/07/mark-calendar-2019-bicycle-sundays/) of the year here in Seattle and I took advantage by going for a ride with some coworkers.

My biking has really been slacking off in recent months, so my goal for May is to bike every single day. I'm not putting any distance or time requirements, even pedaling up and down my alley counts (thankfully I haven't had to resort to that level of lameness yet). I swapped the pedals on my bike from being SPD clip-ins to being combo SPD clip on one side and regular flats on the other. Being able to just hop on my bike with regular shoes makes running little errands so much more appealing since I don't have to worry about carrying or not-carrying regular shoes.
