For a long time, I've used VPN solutions like WireGuard and Tailscale to get into my home network when not at home. They work really well, but recently I've been using [Pangolin](https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin) to easily access services I run at home from a web-browser.

It's a reverse proxy that has it's own auth, so my home network is protected with two-factor auth. It also handles getting SSL certs has handy plugins for geoblock to block traffic from another country (I'm in the US) and crowdsec for automatically blocking IPs that do suspicious things.

My main motivation here was that my work laptop (rightfully) doesn't let me use my own VPN, so if I want to listen to my music using Navidrome at work I need a different solution. I've been buying mp3s to better support artists so getting access to my own server from anywhere is real handy. With Pangolin I can just open a weblink in my browser and BAM I'm in. No network layer shenanigans needed. You can also send timelimited links to friends if there's something you want share with them.

It's great!
