With my PCB collection getting too large for me to realistically play all of my games, I traded 2
games that I never play to get an [In the Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Hunt) PCB.  The
guy I traded with was local here in the Seattle area so I drove out to his house and traded
Raiden II and Puzzle Bobble 4 for In the Hunt.  I think he got the better end of the deal, but now
my collection is smaller and those games will get played.  Win win!  Plus, I got to see a
[Taito Egret II](http://wiki.arcadeotaku.com/w/Taito_Egret_II) cabinet in person, which was pretty
neat.

In college an arcade near campus had In the Hunt and I played it quite a bit.  On top of the
nostalgia, the art style and animation are what really makes this game for me.  As an STG, it's not
a great game, but the graphics are awesome.  If you've played the Metal Slug games then you'll see some
style similarities; this is because members of the team that worked on the game at Irem would later
form Nazca and [create Metal Slug](http://metalslug.wikia.com/wiki/The_origin_of_Metal_Slug).

Here's a video of someone 1CC'ing In the Hunt:
