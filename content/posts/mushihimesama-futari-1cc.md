I imported [Mushihimesama Futari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama_Futari) for 360 right when it came out since it was region-free and could be played on a US 360.  It has recently been released as part of the [Platinum Collection in Japan](http://www.play-asia.com/Mushihimesama_Futari_Ver_1.5_Platinum_Collection/paOS-13-71-br-49-en-70-3yu5.html), so if you are at all curious about modern shooting games I would _highly_ recommend checking it out.  It's a fantastic game.  You may recognize it from this video that was circulating on the internets a few years ago:



That video is from Futari's Ultra Mode, which has insane amounts of bullets and is insanely hard.  Thankfully there are non-Ultra modes that mere mortals can enjoy.

Ever since I got the game I have been very slowly chipping away at a 1CC of Original mode. 1CC is short for **1** **C**redit **C**lear, which means that you beat the game without continuing.  It's easy to "beat" shooting games if you just continue over and over, but that's not how it's done.

Today, Friday May 20th 2011, I 1CC'd Mushihimesama Futari on Original Mode!

This 1CC was Ver. 1.5 Original Mode using Palm with Abnormal Shot type.  Final score: 189,352,383.

Oh yea!
