## Music

- [Pavement on Austin City Limits](https://www.pbs.org/video/pavement-eceupd/) - We're all getting old. 
- [Hank Shocklee talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqWpIHbNqx0) - Hank Shocklee is a genius, he's part of [The Bomb Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bomb_Squad) who did a lot of production for Public Enemy, the first Ice Cube solo album, etc. 2 hours long but worth it. "I want shit that when you're walking down the street you feel like you're the most baddest motherfucker on the planet."

## Misc

- ["2001: A Space Odyssey" directed by George Lucas?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_suy7gARps) - pretty funny and silly.
- [DOS Game Club](https://www.dosgameclub.com) - Monthly podcast where they pick a game, play it, and then talk about it. Lots of memories in these games, if you played DOS games I'm sure they discussed something you loved.
- ["iPhones are made in hell"](https://restofworld.org/2023/foxconn-iphone-factory-china/) - “Factories might not give you a great life,” Chen said. “But at least you won’t starve.” Goddamn.
