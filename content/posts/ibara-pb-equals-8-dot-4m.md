I've been getting back into [Ibara](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ibarapinksweets/ibarapinksweets.htm) and streaming on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/pdp80) a little bit. I was able to improve my personal best to 8,442,540! Closer to that letter score (which is 10 million for those not familiar with Yagawa scoring)!
