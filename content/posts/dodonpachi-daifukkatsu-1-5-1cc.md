(NOTE: This technically is not a 1CC, it's a 1-ALL since this game has multiple loops and I only cleared the first loop.  1-ALL means I cleared all the stages of the first loop.)

This game was actually my first ever Cave 1CC.  The easiest way to play it is on [iOS from the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dodonpachi-resurrection/id387176580?mt=8) and let me tell you, it is worth every penny since Cave does a really great job porting their games to iOS.

So I played it a ton last summer after it came out for iOS, then at one of the shmupmeets (9/11/10) at the old Pink Gorilla arcade, a local collector loaned his arcade PCB for the meet and I got to play the arcade version. My iOS training came in handy and I was actually able to get a 1CC on the first night I ever played the arcade version.

Now, I should note that I 1CC'd using Strong Mode, which due to auto-bombing makes the 1CC pretty easy.  However, I'm still proud of the fact that I was able to 1CC something in public with people watching.

Since then, the game has come out on 360 which I of course bought but I hadn't 1CC'd the game on that version, so I figured I'd put some time in and get that out of the way.  DONE:

My scores are pretty awful, but I survived....
