In August 2019, I biked **197 miles**. Bit of a drop from last month for a few reasons:

* I was on pager duty for work which makes going for long rides and commuting via bike difficult. I could have done Peloton rides, but I just didn't OK!?!
* We had friends come and stay with us for almost a week which made it tough to get bike time in, but that's ok!

My biking total for 2019 is now **1,436 miles** which is just 64 miles short of the 1,500 mile goal I set at the beginning of the year. Could I hit 2,000 miles by the end of the year?!
