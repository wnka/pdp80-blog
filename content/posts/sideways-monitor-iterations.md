Before I got an arcade cabinet, I had done many things to approximate one while playing shooting games.  In remembrance of these setups, I thought I'd share them.

Dotronix monitor I got on craigslist for $10.
  
This is just a big VGA monitor running at 640x480.  It looked pretty good for what it was, but after I got the [Ketsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui:_Kizuna_Jigoku_Tachi) port I needed scanlines.

Scanlines!  This looked totally awesome.  Unfortunately, the blue pin (that's pin #5) on the RGB input, which had been flaky for years, stopped working and everything turned yellow. I tried to fix it, but couldn't, so I had to move on.

The Amiga monitor looked a lot better, but this was pretty decent and was what I used for a while.

These setups served me well, but now that I've reached the TRUE LAST BOSS and gotten a proper cabinet, I look forward to reducing the number of sideways monitors in our house.
