In honor of Halloween and spooky things, I was thinking about the first time I was scared by a video game. This would have been [Dino Eggs on the Commodore 64.](https://www.lemon64.com/review/dino-eggs/965)

**DINO MOM COMING**

When the Dino mom came to protect her eggs, a giant leg would come out of the sky and try to step on you. If it crushed you, a loud crazy sound effect played and your dead body laid there smoking. I don't know why it was smoking, or whatever those wavy lines were supposed to represent, but that terrified me the most. Well that and the idea of a giant leg coming out of the sky and crushing you.

I got to the point where I couldn't play it, and if someone else was playing it I couldn't watch.
