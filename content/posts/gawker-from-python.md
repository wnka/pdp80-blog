[Gawker Image Fetch Script](http://www.carrel.org/articles/2006/06/11/gawker-image-fetch-script)  



Andy Carrel has written a Python script that will download images from a shared Gawker webcam and write the newest image out to a file.  He uses it to put his webcam of Mt. Si on his site which you can see [here](http://www.carrel.org/webcam/).





I gotta say, it's pretty cool to see someone do this and make Gawker more available to others.  I have always wanted to add the capability to publish images onto a website since that is a much more robust/available sharing mechanism than the socket stuff that's in Gawker right now.  Maybe I'll do that some day.





I actually wrote a Gawker client in Visual Basic a little while back since I had to learn something about .Net.  If people are interested I could post the source for that, it's real simple, just connects and gets the images from a shared camera.  Doesn't record or anything since I didn't want to invest that much time in it.





The socket communications are really basic for Gawker, I would like to make them more robust but there are so many hours in the day.
