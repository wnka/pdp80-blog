I got a slow start to biking this year for various reasons (lazyness, back pain, lazyness) but toward the end of April I started up again and am now hitting my goal of 40 miles per week consistently. I've been doing early morning rides on Saturdays with a friend, which has really helped me stay committed.

I've gone 419 miles so far this year. I'm going to set the same goal as I set last year: 1,500 miles.

With 30 weeks left in 2016, I'll need to average about 36 miles per week to hit 1,500 miles. I'm gonna go for it. This week I rode 67.4 miles (3 commutes + long Saturday morning ride) so I definitely think I can make it.
