This month I set the goal of biking every day and I did it. It's been great! I biked **268.3 miles** in total and most rides were short, but on the last day of the month I went on the longest ride I've ever done at **45.3 miles** to serve as a finale. I rode from my house to **Bel**levue, through **Red**mond, south on the eastside of Lake **Sam**mamish, then west across **Mer**cer Island and finally back to **Sea**ttle. I shall call this route **BelRedSamMerSea**!

I super enjoyed this route. The trail around the east side of Lake Sammamish was a flat ride and other parts had some hills to climb but nothing horrible. I will say that by the end of the ride I was pretty exhausted and was slowly creeping home. Some day I want to do a century ride (100 miles) but damn, by the end of this ride I would be less than half way there which was a reality check that I've got a long way to go before I can pull that off...
