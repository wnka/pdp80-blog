I took a break from playing for about a week and a half, then on my second credit after playing
again I was able to 1-ALL
[Muchi Muchi Pork](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/muchimuchipork/muchimuchipork.htm)!

**Final score:** 115,449,200

My best score is 119,827,720 but I played a little more conservatively than usual to get the
1-ALL. That stage 5 boss was a total mess, I went in with 5 lives in stock and barely made it on my
last life with zero bombs.

Such a great game! Had a lot of fun learning it! I'm tempted to go back and learn the stage 5 boss
better and improve my score, but that will have to come later.

What to play next?
