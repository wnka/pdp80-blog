Happy Thanksgiving! Before heading out to Thanksgiving dinner with friends, I put some time into [Mushihimesama Futari Black Label](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama_Futari) and managed to finally get a Maniac mode 1cc!

I had gotten really close a couple of times, like "4px of life left on the final boss" close, so I'm glad to have finally done it. The last boss was a bit of a bomb fest, but oh well, got the 1cc!

This port for XBox 360 came out almost exactly three years ago and I got it the day after Thanksgiving in 2009. I think it's safe to say I've gotten my money's worthâ€¦

Video!
