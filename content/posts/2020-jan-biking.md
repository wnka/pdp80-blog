In January I biked **309 miles** which is pretty great. My paternity leave ended on Jan 6 and every day I went into work in January I biked[^1]. Biking is by far the best way for me to get to work since it takes a very consistent amount of time. No traffic or late busses to deal with.

Consistency is super important to my schedule these days since with a kiddo at home I need to plan out my day a lot more than I used to. I’ve been working pretty fixed hours and ensuring that I’m home at a certain time to help out my wife with the baby. 

Weather has been really rainy, even for Seattle. I use two [paniers/saddlebags](https://www.amazon.com/Ortlieb-Back-Roller-Panniers-Various-Patterns/dp/B0063879QQ) to transport my stuff, which includes a change of clothes since I shower at work. Things that have really helped with riding comfortably in the rain:
1. [Waterproof shoes](https://www.amazon.com/Fizik-X5-Artica-Shoe-Black/dp/B077H5QVVJ)
1. [Waterproof gloves](https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-Izumi-AMFIB-Lobster-Gloves/dp/B00SOMS8AK)
1. [Wool socks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TA73Z6)
1. [Balaclava](https://www.amazon.com/Minus33-Merino-Wool-Midweight-Balaclava/dp/B01LZH96TH)

I also mixed in 10 minute Peloton “cool down” rides after I got home each day and rode to the grocery store on weekends to get in more miles. In February I’m going to continue commuting but I might cool it on other rides and try to do something else with that time. I kinda miss video games...

[^1]: I didn’t bike to work on my wife’s birthday since we went and had a nice breakfast. Reasonable exception!
