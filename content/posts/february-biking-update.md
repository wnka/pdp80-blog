With today being the last day of February and a beautiful day here in Seattle, I went for a 14.8 mile ride along the Burke Gilman trail up to Matthews Beach. So in February I biked 126.8 miles, putting me at 325.8 miles so far this year. That leaves 1,174.2 miles for my goal of 1,500 miles this year.

I biked less in February than in January due to a trip for work that made me miss a week of biking to work, as well as a trip to visit my brother. However, I'm still on a good pace to meet my goal!
