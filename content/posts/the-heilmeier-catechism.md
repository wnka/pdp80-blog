Someone I work with [shared this](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism) with me and I've found it to be great at getting folks to think deeply about projects they're proposing.

> George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the "Heilmeier Catechism" to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.
>
> 1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
> 1. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
> 1. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
> 1. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
> 1. What are the risks?
> 1. How much will it cost?
> 1. How long will it take?
> 1. What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
