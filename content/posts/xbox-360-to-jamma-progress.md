After a lot of soldering and tinkering, I've got my 360 hooked up to my Astro City. Oh man oh man oh man!

I got a [JAMMA fingerboard](http://www.jammaboards.com/store/jamma-fingerboard/prod_1.html?ccSID285e73f64c04744fc5f33ff68f529742=5ed66449bb0b8f9d425a012dd489e53c) from [jammaboards.com](http://jammaboards.com).  [JAMMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Amusement_Machinery_Manufacturers_Association) is a standard that most arcade cabinets and boards use (after about 1985) and a fingerboard enables you to wire up components to a JAMMA connector.  My cabinet has a JAMMA connector, so to hook up my 360 I need to supply video, joystick, and sound signals to that connector.

For the video signal, I hooked my Ultracade UVC up to the video and power pins.  Straightforward stuff.

Up next was controls.  This was a total pain since I decided to rip apart a wired 360 controller and solder onto the contacts.  I've done this before when building joysticks and it's a lot of work. Thankfully, I was able to get it wired up.

Finally, sound.  I needed an amp since with JAMMA the game board is responsible for amplifying the sound signal.  I ordered an [amp off Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KZNP4) and wired it up.  Worked like a charm!

Champion the cat approves!

So while it all works, it ain't pretty:

I need to figure out how to contain this mess....
