In Feb 2018, I biked 123 miles. This is less than I would have liked, but two things reduced my miles:

* I was on pager duty one week for work. I still biked a few days, but biking while you could get paged at any moment isn't exactly fun.
* It's been *cold* here in Seattle. I'm fine down to freezing since I have warm gear, but once it gets below freezing I don't bike. I don't want to hit some ice and biff it.

This weekend I changed the chain and brake pads on my bike so I'm ready to get my milage back up in March. I haven't changed my chain since I got my bike in 2015 and wow, things are so much smoother now.
