I use Emacs.  A lot.

I decided to post my [color-theme](http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/) themes on github for all to see.  [They are available here](https://github.com/wnka/emacs-color-themes).

There are two that I flip back and forth between every so often.  Currently I'm using this brown-ish theme:

When I get bored with that one, I use this neon theme:

![Neon](/images/neon.png)

That neon one might look familiar because it's based on the [Monokai](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/) theme for TextMate.  I based mine on this [port to Emacs](http://jaguilar.posterous.com/i-get-so-tired-of-searching-fo) and then added things like settings for [egg-mode](https://github.com/byplayer/egg) and [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) since I use those modes _a lot_.

Enjoy!
