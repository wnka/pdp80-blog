Today I rode around the north half of Lake Washington\. I rode the Burke\-Gilman trail up to Kenmore and stopped at [The Ranch Drive\-in](http://www.ranchdrivein.com) for a burger and chocolate shake\. That hella hit the spot\. From there, I rode up [Juanita Drive](http://www.bicycleclimbs.com/Default.aspx?ClimbId=21) \(which is a pretty rough climb\) and went down through Kirkland before hitting the 520 bridge and heading home\. I've done this ride before and it's becoming my go-to long weekend ride. I dig it because it starts nice and flat, but then you get some challenging hills.

Total distance: **35\.7 miles**
