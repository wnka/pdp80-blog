[Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories - Escargot Grand Prix](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/GawkerMovies)  

[MAKE: Blog: Escargot Grand Prix - DIY Time lapse snail races](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/06/escargot_grand_prix_diy_time_l.html)  

  



Windell Oskay of [evilmadscientist.com](http://www.evilmadscientist.com) created a really cool movie with Gawker that enabled some snails to give the appearance of going fast.  Awesome stuff!  The blog at [Make](http://www.makezine.com) picked up on this and, much to my surprise, Gawker showed up on their site.  Thanks to Windell and thanks to the folks at Make!
