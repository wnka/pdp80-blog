Version 1.5 of Ketsui Arrange was released recently by [trap15](https://twitter.com/trap0xf).  You can read more about it [here](http://dodonpachi.daifukkat.su/ketarr/). Basically, weapons were rebalanced and suicide bullets were added at high rank which makes the game _way_ harder.

I burned an EPROM of it, slapped it on my Ketsui board and recorded the first couple of times I played it.
