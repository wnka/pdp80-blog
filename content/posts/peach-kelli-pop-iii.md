[I've been listening to this album a lot lately and I really like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpHZopJh5g&list=OLAK5uy_nhtH0ZZuPcRx4gCgqV7zHXpckbwCWNhUc). "Peach Kelli Pop" is the artist and the album is "III". It's poppy and punky and the songs are super catchy. 

Favorite songs:
- Shampoo
- Plastic Love
- Bat Wing
