I love it: https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/

So much web content is full of this stuff. I just want to read something on your site! I don't want to you to e-mail me, I don't want notifications from your site, I don't want to sign up for your newsletter, I don't want to know about your Patreon. This is like asking me to marry your site before even saying 'hello'.
