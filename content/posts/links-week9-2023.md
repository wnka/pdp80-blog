## Music

- [MC Hammer Was Uncomfortably Bricked Up In ‚ÄúPumps and a Bump‚Äù | The Danny Brown Show Highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-YaxdTKR1w) - One of the funniest things I've seen in a while. First off, anyone who tries to say they didn't like MC Hammer as a kid is lying. I saw that video of you performing '2 Legit 2 Quit' at your 5th grade talent show. But this... this is late-era Hammer. I had no idea. Also, it looks like this video was filmed at his [Fremont, CA mansion](https://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/m-c-hammers-house-former/view/google/). **MY HOMETOWN!!!** ü¶ì ü¶ì ü¶ì ü¶ì
- [So Wassup? Episode 51 | Gang Starr - "Brainstorm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYbcjk0uZWU) - Brainstorm is one of my favorite Gang Starr songs so it's great to see it covered on [So Wassup?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWDrXC9_8Kmgwu2zeWdDU1n6fPqIh98Xr)

## Gaming

- [Iconic 'All Your Base' Meme Gets Added To The Arcade Version Of Zero Wing](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/03/iconic-all-your-base-meme-gets-added-to-the-arcade-version-of-zero-wing) - Strange that they fixed some of the grammatical weirdness. My favorite in that was always "somebody set up us the bomb".
- [Donald Trump and Joe Biden get into heated argument about Shmups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOkGnNujLfo) - This is pretty much how all shmup discussions go. But really Joe, [battop](https://focusattack.com/controls/joysticks/joystick-accessories/battop-handles/)?!
