A quick review of some movies that either have 'cop' in the title or where the main characters are cops.

### Judge Dredd (1995)

This movie is real bad and not enjoyable. Stallone is trying to act *so* hard and does a lot of having a hair trigger temper where he's calm one millisecond and the next millisecond he's super pissed and screaming at someone. I call this "[Pacino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino)-ing." He tries. I had to rewind a few times just to confirm that *yes* it appears that Sly is wearing blue contact lenses. So puzzling.

### Demolition Man (1993)

This movie and Judge Dredd are very similar and I get them confused in my head all the time, but this movie is enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, it's not good, but it's enjoyable. Wesley Snipes totally crushes it. Did you know that in some countries they changed dubbed over Taco Bell and made it Pizza Hut? [Please refer to this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSOq-UEYda8).

Also, both Judge Dredd and Demolition Man have Rob Schneider in them, which I guess he and Stallone were buddies or something. He sucks in both movies, and he sucks in real life too since he's now a anti-vax right-wing dingdong. 

### Dredd (2012)

This movie rules. It doesn't fuck around, it's right into the action and doesn't stop. Everything is explained super economically, there's no exposition goofiness where someone is like "Hey Dredd why'd you become a judge?" and then there's a long flashback or explanation. There's no time for that crap in this movie, everyone is too busy trying to stay alive and ducking for cover.

### Violent Cop (1989)

Usually when a movie's title is of the form '\<Adjective\> Cop' it's bad, but this movie is really good. [Takeshi Kitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kitano), who you might recognize as Vic Romano from [MXC / Most Extreme Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Extreme_Elimination_Challenge), both acts in and directs this and he's made a lot of great movies in Japan. The final showdown with the sliding door opening and letting more light in to reveal the bad guy is really cool. 

### Hana-bi / Fireworks (1997)

Another Takeshi Kitano movie, I actually saw this movie in the theater when it came out (shoutout to [The Mayan Theater in Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_Theater_(Denver))). I was in high school, it definitely left an impression on me then and did again when I rewatched it recently. It's very touching but also has moments of intense violence and comedy. A great movie.

### Samurai Cop (1991)

Ok back to goofiness. This movie is great, great in the sense that it's low budget and awkward and corny but super fun. Very quotable. Look out for that wig!

### The Raid (2011) / The Raid 2 (2014)

These movies are both fantastic, just watch them and get your mind blown with amazing martial arts and hard boiled action.

### RoboCop 2 (1990)

First RoboCop is a classic, this one isn't too bad. I actually saw this in the theater when it came out. I would have been only 10 but having an older brother and older neighborhood friends helped me see a lot of R-rated movies in the theater. Not gonna lie, I freeze-framed when they were fighting in the arcade to try and recognize games. Data East made 2 RoboCop arcade games, so they were mostly Data East games like Midnight Resistance. There seemed to be a Dragon's Lair cab at one point with the logo spray painted over. Oh right, the movie. The stop motion effects on RoboCop 2 (so funny that the machine in the movie is named like the movie) are really amazing. Having a little kid be evil and get murdered is pretty weird looking back on it. I definitely didn't sit in the theater when I was 10 going "oh wow Hob is so cool!"

### Cobra (1985)

Goddamn this movie is silly. Peak 80s Stallone though, not stupid 90s Stallone like the above. Still pretty stupid though... this lady maybe sees the bad guy, and the bad guy doesn't want her to tell on him, so he starts killing tons of people and going after the cops and makes things way worse. I like to imagine him being like "oh no oh no oh geez now we've got to try and cover this up too!" That random music video that shows up with all the robots is the *best*. I also love that what the bad guy gang is trying to accomplish is never made clear. The movie just shows them meeting up and clanging axes together and acts like that is supposed to be enough. It was the 80s so it's just some satanic panic shit probably.

### Cure (1997)

Great movie, hard to explain. If someone you know randomly draws a big X on the wall, bad times are coming.

### Stone Cold (1991)

The opening scene of this movie is some bad guys robbing a grocery store. Roughly the 3rd shot of the movie is one of the bad guys unloading an assault rifle into a display of Ritz crackers and there are Ritz flying everywhere. They cut to the head bad guy and he's screaming at the top of his lungs "I LOVE IT" and then they cut back to the other guy but now he's unloading into a different display of chips. I don't know if this is a continuity error or on purpose, he wants to spend all his ammo on snacks, but just like the head bad guy *I LOVE IT*. This movie is so absurd but it's so fun. Brian "The Boz" Bosworth is a cop who plays by his own rules, most notably the rule of having the most amazing mullet. I won't waste your bandwidth, but if you want to see this mullet just image search "Stone Cold Boz Mullet" and buckle up.
