I missed week 7 since I was visiting family.

## Music
- [Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela - Rejoice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s17NVJ_IHfo&list=OLAK5uy_kd1LFhe9oU1my0P9ODouNuJLmQ7Kx9FdM) - Wow, this is good. I don't know anything about "afrobeat", I know who Fela Kuti _is_ but I know zero of his music or that genre. I'm going to have to learn more! I found out about this from the [Makaya McCraven episode of "What's in my Bag"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmaNvzBClUc)... I don't know that artist either but I always find good music from that channel.

## Movies

- [Lupin III: The First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_III:_The_First) - This was fun, I learned about it from the [Accented Cinema](https://www.youtube.com/@AccentedCinema) channel on Youtube.

## Misc

- [Nicolae Ceaușescu: The Dracula of Being A Dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ske8WQB_jHw) - Four part series from [Behind the Bastards](https://www.youtube.com/@BehindTheBastards) podcast. Ceaușescu was a Romanian dictator until he was overthrown and shot on Christmas Day 1989. I've only made it through part one so far but it's great so far.
