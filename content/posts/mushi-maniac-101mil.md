I have been spending a little time here and there playing shmups and [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pdp80). Today I played a single credit of [Mushihimesama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama) Maniac mode and got a new personal best score of 101,210,364! I'm proud to have finally broken 100 million, even though I blew it on the last boss and didn't get the 1cc.

I don't exactly what I did to get such a good score, I know I had a high counter coming out of the stage 4 midboss. Need to reproduce this and get the clear!

BTW, the scoring in this game is absolutely insane. [This episode of STG Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqeRrfh3Ico) details all the crazy things you can do to get like **3 BILLION** points with low shot power and crazy frame perfect autofire tricks. I'm not going to be going for that level, but I do like seeing how I'm hitting the buttons with my input display!
