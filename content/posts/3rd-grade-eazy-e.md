In the 3rd grade, our teacher had us write a journal. My mom recently found it and I made a PDF out of it. This entry is now 35 years old:

> I felt bad this morning because I tried to record some music called Eazy-E but I ended up recording nothing. The rest of my day I felt fine.

Having an older brother and older neighbor kids meant I got exposed to a lot of "age inappropriate" music. We had borrowed a neighbor's vinyl copy of Eazy-E's [Eazy Duz It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-Duz-It) and I was trying to tape it but I messed up. We did tape it succesfully eventually.

My parents had very different views of that music. My mom didn't like it for very obvious reasons and we had to hide our tapes, but my dad thought it was absolutely hilarious. His favorite line was "So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fucking with" from [Gangsta Gangsta](https://genius.com/24976146/Nwa-gangsta-gangsta/So-let-me-tell-ya-muthafuckaz-who-you-fuckin-with). [YouTube link at the right timestamp](https://youtu.be/aCAkHFavEdw?t=282). That always made him laugh so hard.
