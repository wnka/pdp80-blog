In September 2018, I rode my bike 132 miles. My wife and I were in Japan from September 21st to October 3rd, which cut my biking time but I still commuted via bike and took a few longer rides. I'm working on a post about our Japan trip.

2018 total miles: **1,007!** I broke my goal of 1,000 miles with 3 months to go!
