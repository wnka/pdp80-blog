Have you ever seen ["The Octogon" from 1980 starring Chuck Norris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Octagon_(film))? You haven't? Well, it's a silly movie, but the silliest aspect of it is Chuck Norris whispering his inner thoughts about ninjas. His whispers have a real cool echo/reverb effect too. My favorite is when he whispers outloud "oh my god" and then whispers internally "ninja!"

[Thankfully someone compiled a video of just the whisper scenes of the movie. Enjoy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM5lOk2JHI8)
