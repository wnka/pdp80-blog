Calling this "Stuff!" now instead of "Links!" since maybe I'll put more than just links.

I've been sick for the last few days, not COVID but pretty crappy regardless. Lots of sleeping and taking it easy.

# Gaming
- [RetroLongplay on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/retrolongplay) - While I was sick and fading in and out of napping, I had this running in the background. It's a channel that just shows playthroughs of games on an endless loop. What I caught was of the TAS (tool assisted speedrun) variety, which use glitches and exploits to beat games as quickly as possible. Occasionally I'd wake up to something I cared about like Contra games but mostly it just served as background noise.
- Resident Evil 4 remake came out and I blew the dust off my gaming PC, got all the updates it needed which took like 4 reboots, downloaded the game and started playing it. All that updating ate into my play time, then I got sick. Looking forward to spending more time with it. When the original came out on GameCube in 2005 I had just gotten dumped and I spent a lot of time playing it. Soon after I beat it I met my wife, so RE4 will always hold a special spot in my heart.

# Biking
- [Chilly Hilly 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elRP7Nccc-E) - Someday I want to bike something like this. A long time ago, pre-COVID and pre-parenting I [biked to the Vashon ferry](/posts/bike-vashon/) and rode around, but I need to put in some work to get back to that level. [Bob's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bobco85) is a great resource for Seattle bikers as he shows different routes and key junction points.
- I've had my Vanmoof S3 e-Bike for almost 2 years and it's been fantastic. I've been going into the office at least 3 days a week lately and I ride it everyday. It's a great way to commute, I can get to the office in about 20 minutes and not be sweaty! I really think e-Bikes are a game changer for city commuting. 

# Music
- [Wipers - Taking Too Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyLvOjpP-Aw) - this song rules.
- [Spacemen 3 - It's Allright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTAWpU8npX8) - Cover of a [Bo Diddley song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjTra-2OF08) and Spacemen 3 are how I learned that Bo Diddley rules, before I just thought he was some old rock guy. So wrong! "Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs to" is a genius album title, the Spacemen apparently like drugs.

# Podcasts
- The Dollop - Rickey Henderson [Part One](https://omny.fm/shows/the-dollop-with-dave-anthony-and-gareth-reynolds/574-rickey-henderson-part-one) and [Part Two](https://omny.fm/shows/the-dollop-with-dave-anthony-and-gareth-reynolds/575-rickey-henderson-part-two) - I was SO excited when I saw The Dollop was covering Rickey Henderson. Growing up, I *idolized* Rickey big time. When I played little league I had those same Mizuno batting gloves he wore. A friend of mine tried to copy him by sliding head first into a base and ended up breaking his arm. I didn't know anything about his backstory or how much the league screwed with him so this was a great listen.
