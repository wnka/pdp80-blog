Our cat Champion passed away on July 20th 2023. She was 15 years old.

In 2008 my girlfriend (now wife) and I wanted to get a cat. We went to [Kitty Harbor in West Seattle](https://www.yelp.com/biz/emerald-city-kitty-harbor-seattle) and hung out with their kittens. I was sitting in a chair and this kitten came along, jumped on my shoulder, and crawled all over me. I proclaimed "This cat's a fucking champion!" and that's how Champion got her name. She had a sneezy nose when we got her, they said this was just a little 'kitty cold' but that was LIES, she permanently had a cloudy right eye and would always be sneezing on everything. We loved her just the same, she was a great cuddler and buddy. 15 years is a long time, she's been with us through so many life changes. She was very sweet with our daughter, who would sit on her and hug her very aggressively but Champs never minded. 

Champion, we love you and we miss you.
