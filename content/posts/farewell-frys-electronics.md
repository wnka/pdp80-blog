Fry's Electronics has closed and is no more.

{{< figure src="/images/amiga-frys.jpg" >}}

This is the receipt for our Amiga 2000, dated June 10 1989. My dad kept everything and when he passed away there was a lot of stuff to go through, but it was really cool to find this. Growing up in the Bay Area in the 80s/early 90s, I spent **a lot** of time in Fry's. It was a huge influence on my computer nerdery and my dad took me almost every weekend so I could go look at all the cool new things. 

Some Memories:

- Buying our first PC XT clone from the original Fry's in Sunnyvale.
- Buying our NES from the original Fry's.
- Grabbing a free copy of [MicroTimes](https://blzimg.github.io/Microtimes/Microtimes.html) on the way out.
- Crystal Pepsi.
- Reading video game magazines like Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and GameFan there.
- Driving home with our Amiga 2000 with it between my brother and I in the backseat of my dad's 1971 Dodge Challenger. 
- Seeing Amiga demos like the [Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMDyHc6438) and [Walker 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ar0hMGA5KM) demos.
- Commodore CDTV and the [Psygnosis Planetside demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jlFe-VBK1M)
- [Some Sony GPS device](http://retro-gps.info/Sony/Sony-Pyxis-IPS-360/index.html) that was like $900 and was huge and told you Lat, Lon and Alt.
- Wanting Sony portables like the [Discman D-555](https://walkmancentral.com/products/d-z555), the first [MiniDisc player](https://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-1.html), the [Video Walkman](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/sony_video_walkman_video_tv_r.html).
- Buying Wing Commander 2 at the Sunnyvale store (the second Sunnyvale store) while having a really bad sore throat.
- Getting [Michael Jordan In Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan_in_Flight) and we had to upgrade the vram on our video card from 256k to 512k. We bought the loose vram chips at Fry's and installed them on [the card](http://www.vgamuseum.info/index.php/cards/item/498-video-seven-l1a4199).
- [ReelMagic card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealMagic) running Dragon's Lair.
- [Macintosh TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_TV), what a weird machine.
- Seeing [Space Quest 3 intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbXTKuObCQ) on a PC with a sound card and nice speakers. 
- My brother needed a graphing calculator so he, a friend, and I drove to literally every Fry's in the Bay Area to try and find an HP 48G (we were an RPN family). [In Utero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Utero) had just come out and we were driving around blasting it. First time I heard that album.
- Using a bunch of money I had saved up to split the cost of an [HP 95LX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX) with my parents. My dad was stoked I would learn Lotus 1-2-3.
- Final Bay Area Fry's memory from late 1993 before I moved to Colorado: going to the Fremont store and seeing Doom in person for the first time. Mind blowing.
- One summer when I was back visiting, I went to the new Fremont store. They outgrew the original one and it just wasn't the same anymore. The original Fremont store was next to the [NeXT Computer factory](https://www.cultofmac.com/617676/a-brief-history-of-steve-jobs-automated-factory-at-next-cook-book-leftovers/) and the [NUMMI car plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI), which is now the [Tesla Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory).
