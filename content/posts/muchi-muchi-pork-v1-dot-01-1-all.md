Haven't been playing a lot of shmups in recent times, but I played some [Muchi Muchi Pork](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/muchimuchipork/muchimuchipork.htm) on XBox 360 and was able to 1-ALL the game and reach the 2nd loop for the first time!

I own [the PCB](/blog/2014/01/muchi-muchi-pork-pcb/) of this game, which is v1.00 of the game. Differences in v1.01 which is in the XBox 360 port:

- No silly 2nd loop requirement. v1.00 requires no deaths to reach the 2nd loop. v1.01 only requires a one credit clear of the first loop.
- The lard meter burns down slower, making the game considerably easier than v1.00.

Thanks to [my v1.00 clear](/blog/2014/06/muchi-muchi-pork-1-all/), I only needed to play a few games of v1.01 to get to the 2nd loop.

This game is so fun, definitely one of my favorites STGs. The stage 4 and stage 5 bosses remain trainwrecks for me, but thankfully I can keep enough lives in stock to squeak past.

Next goal: Break a billion points in Mushi Futari BL God Mode.
