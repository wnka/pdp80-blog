In July 2019 I biked **355 miles**, a new monthly record! This brings my 2019 total to **1,238 miles!** I did my [longest ride ever](/posts/metric-century-ride/) and bought a [Peloton bike](https://www.onepeloton.com/bike).

Why a Peloton bike?

It was my wife's super smart idea! We are expecting our first child in late October and while my wife is pregnant she wanted an easy way to get some light cardio in. For me, after baby arrives I am not going to be able to do long five hour bike rides for a while. 

My long rides are good efforts, but they're pretty meandering and low intensity. Once a group of older gray haired riders **blew past me** and I thought "damn I wish I could go that fast." I figured that with Peloton I could actually train and track how my output is improving. I've been doing different classes and I really enjoy the HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) rides. I'm already seeing improvement in my outdoor riding when it comes to being able to accelerate and maintain speed going up a hill. I had never really thought much about keeping a steady pedal cadence and that has really helped me think about what gear to be in.

There are always new classes and committing to live classes helps me plan my workouts. I did a class every day from July 17th to July 31st except for one day, so I'm off to a good start.

First ride! Got pretty sweaty! Also, this motivated a much needed garage cleanup and many trips to Goodwill.
