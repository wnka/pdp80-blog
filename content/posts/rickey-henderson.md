Rickey Henderson passed away a few days ago and it hit me hard. I'm not a big sports fan but as a kid growing up in Fremont, CA I was a huge Oakland A's fan and I *totally idolized* Rickey Henderson. I played one year of little league but even then I just had to have a green Mizuno batting glove just like Rickey. I can't really tell you why I idolized him so much, sliding head first and stealing bases just seemed like the coolest thing ever and he just seemed like the coolest guy ever. He came back to the A's in 1989 and helped get them to the [World Series that year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_World_Series). All us East Bay A's fans were happy that they swept the Giants. 

The Dollop podcast did a two-part series on Rickey last year, [Part One is here](https://omny.fm/shows/the-dollop-with-dave-anthony-and-gareth-reynolds/574-rickey-henderson-part-one) and [Part Two is here](https://omny.fm/shows/the-dollop-with-dave-anthony-and-gareth-reynolds/575-rickey-henderson-part-two). His story is really interesting and he's definitely quite the character, but seemed like a good guy.
