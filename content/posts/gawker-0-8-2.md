Gawker 0.8.2 has been [released](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Download.html).  This release fixes a bug that was introduced in 0.8.1 that caused desktop recording to not work correctly.  Sorry 'bout that!

The source code for this version is in the [git repository](http://gawker.git.sourceforge.net) and has been tagged “v0.8.2″.

If you have Gawker 0.8.1 the new version will be picked up by 'Check for Updates', otherwise please [download it manually](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Download.html).

Thanks!
