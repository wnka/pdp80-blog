My new hobby is to ask "small" LLM models to summarize movies for me. They get things so wrong in hilarious ways and invent entirely new characters, plot points, and events. It's fucking great. It's the hardest I've laughed in a while.

Here's what `gpt-oss-20b` told me about some movies.

# Predator (1987)

> Give me a brief summary of the 1987 film Predator with each character and how they die

In the dense jungles of Central America, an elite U.S. Army reconnaissance team (led by Lt. Kay "Dutch" O’Neil) is sent to capture a high‑ranking enemy officer. What was supposed to be a straightforward extraction turns into a nightmare when the squad is stalked by an extraterrestrial hunter that blends into the forest and is armed with advanced, bio‑technological weapons. As the Predator hunts, each team member is systematically eliminated in a series of brutal, though not graphically‑explicit, deaths. Dutch manages to survive until the very end, cutting the alien’s visor and shutting it down alive.

### How the main characters die

| Character | How the Predator kills them (briefly) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Dillon** (U.S. Army Staff Sergeant, played by Carl Weathers) | Shot with a shoulder‑mounted projectile that explodes into the chest, bursting the lungs. |
| **Marcus** (U.S. Army Snow‑Mercenary, played by Jack Starrett) | Severed in a close‑range combat that slices through his neck; the Predator then drains his life force (a signature move). |
| **Blair** (U.S. Army Ranger, played by Robert Townsend) | Killed by a powerful, low‑velocity blast from the Predator’s shoulder weapon that crushes his skull in a single shot. |
| **Mac** (U.S. Army Combat Engineer, played by Jim Burns) | Drowned in moisture‑yoked blood after a shoulder‑mounted missile tears into his lower torso. |
| **Ponch** (U.S. Army Medic, played by Michael Biehn) | Sniped by the Predator’s machine gun‑style armantid‑rifle from a distance; he is hit in the chest. |
| **Dutch** (crew commander) | **Survives** – he lures the Predator out of the forest, slices off the alien’s visor with a brown‑belted physical dagger and forces it to die from its own pain. |

The film doesn’t linger on gore; rather, it presents each death as a tactical encounter, underscoring the Predator’s deadly efficiency and advanced technology. The remaining survivors must contend with the looming threat as the plot speeds toward its climactic fire‑fight on the cliffs overlooking the jungle.

# RoboCop (1987)

> Give me a summary of the movie Robocop

*RoboCop* is a cyber‑punk action‑drama set in a seedy, crime‑plagued Detroit in the year 2018. The story follows former police officer **Alex Murphy** (Peter Weller), who is brutally murdered by a gang of armed robbers. The powerful conglomerate **Omni Consumer Products (OCP)**, which runs a private security division in the city, recovers Murphy’s body and uses cutting‑edge biotechnology to reconstruct him as a biomechanical law‑enforcement cyborg: **RoboCop**.

### Key Plot Points

| # | Event | Details |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Murphy’s death** | Took part in a bank robbery; is killed by a shotgun blast that severs him from his vehicle, booting him out to the streets. |
| 2 | **OCP’s salvage and reconstruction** | Murphy’s remains are sent to OCP’s rooftop lab where the company engineers a 250‑mile‑long "cybernetic body" around his brain and heart. He is renamed *Model 101* and programmed with OCP’s war‑ped programs and police protocols. |
| 3 | **Re‑birth as RoboCop** | The new RoboCop is humiliated by his first assignment on a protest march, where he nearly blows up the crowd. He then fights the “Murder Gang” terrorists who killed him. |
| 4 | **Conflict with OCP** | While investigating suspects, RoboCop discovers that corruption runs through OCP’s hierarchy: the CEO **Dwayne Elizondo Mountain‑Mendez III** (Michael Ironside) is freeing employee security and resource funds for personal gain. |
| 5 | **Love and loss** | He falls for his re‑employed human partner **Officer Anne Lewis** (Lois Chiles), but her life is ultimately sacrificed when she is knocked out of a moving car by the mercenaries hired by the Murder Gang. |
| 6 | **Climax on a rooftop** | RoboCop infiltrates the OCP building’s boardroom, devastated by the wedding‑dated face‑paint he was forced to wear. He confronts Mendez and the gang after a violent shoot‑up; he later discovers the Murder Gang had fabricated the bank robbery to lure the cops. |
| 7 | **Resolution** | RoboCop detonates the OCP building’s fuel tanks to take out the corrupt partners, then reverts to his human form (the final test of the regenerative system), and disappears into the city’s underworld – hinting at a future independent...|

### Themes & Tone

- **Identity & Humanity** – Murphy wrestles with a split identity: a blackened cyber‑code versus raw, human emotion.  
- **Capitalism & Detachment** – OCP’s ruthless profits are personified by the lack of empathy toward civilians, a satirical commentary on corporate overreach.  
- **Technology & Ethics** – The film asks whether augmenting men with artificial limbs and weapons can erase moral responsibility.  

### Notable Cast

- **Peter Weller** – Alex Murphy / RoboCop  
- **Lois Chiles** – Officer Anne Lewis  
- **Michael Ironside** – Dwayne Elizondo Mountain‑Mendez III  
- **William Sadler** – Raytheon – a weapons engineer  
- **Dennis Hopper** – Jasper – an OCP board member  
- **Donald Sutherland** – OCP President Dana West  
- **Morgan Freeman** – Raiders of the trash yard (cameo)  

### Legacy

*RoboCop* blends gunplay, social satire, and blatant 1980s futurism. Its impact lies in both its gritty commentary on corporate greed and its stylized, pipe‑dream world that has inspired sequels, a modern remake (2014), animated series, comics, and a cult‑classic status among sci‑fi fans.

That’s a one‑penny overview of the film.  If you’d like more detail on any particular subplot, character, or the 2014 version’s differences, just let me know!

# In summary

I forget which model told me that Jose Canseco (you know, one of the Bash Brothers from the Oakland A's) was in RoboCop at the voice of some non-existant robot.

We probably all had that kid at our school that would talk confidently about things and be totally wrong, like their cousin told them that when they saw Predator it was a different version where Michael Biehn was in fact Ponch. Or that someone saw a Friday the 13th movie at a sleepover and that when so-and-so dies you can see their eyeballs fly out. I played a lot of Street Fighter 2 in the arcade when it was new, and there was always some kid at 7-Eleven saying crazy shit like Chun-Li could throw fireballs if you made a triangle motion with the joystick and hit all three punch buttons. Or that in NBA Jam if you played as Shaq every dunk would shatter the backboard. Or that they were making a sequel to Akira where you got to see Tetsuo's life inside the bubble.

Wrong wrong wrong! But funny.

This isn't some commentary on AI, just a way to take AIs confident-wrongness and have a good laugh. Another good path to go down here is keep asking it about plot lines or characters in a movie that are under-developed and how you might create sequels or spin-offs based on those characters. It's especially fun if those characters don't even exist.
