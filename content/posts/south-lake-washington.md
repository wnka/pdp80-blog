Ow my legs. I set out this morning planning on biking over the 520 bridge and then coming back over the I-90 bridge. When I got to the I-90 bridge trailhead, I decided to just go for it and go all the way around the south half of Lake Washington. This wasn't too hard in terms of hills, but goddamn it was a long ride. 

I started out heading east over the 520 bridge and then turning south and biking through Medina. I've lived in Seattle for 12 years but have never gone through that hella baller neighborhood. I think both Gates and Bezos live over there. Lots of private driveways with gates that have lionheads on them and shit. Then I snaked through Bellevue until I hit the I-90 trailhead. I started up the path to go west over the bridge and start heading home, but then headed south to cover new ground. Nice trail until you hit Coulon beach park. I stopped there and took a break and ate snacks. From there you get dumped onto streets as you have to go around the Boeing facility down there. The southwest portion of the trip is a little sketchy since you're just on busy city streets.

I took another break at Seward Park to stretch my back before heading north home. It was 9 more miles from that point, which was mostly flat until the hill climb at Lakeview Park. That climb sucked, I was so wiped by that point. I slowly made my way home.

I gotta say I'm pretty damn proud of this ride.

Total mileage for the week: **84.3 miles**
