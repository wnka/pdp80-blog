[Macam](http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/) is a wonderful library that greatly improves the support for USB webcams in Mac OS X.  The list of supported cameras is available [here](http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/cameras/index.php).

Gawker can take advantage of Macam, so check it out if you're trying to get your USB webcam to work with Gawker.  Just install the macam.component as directed and you're set!
