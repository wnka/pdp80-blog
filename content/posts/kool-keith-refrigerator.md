Kool Keith is a genius and [here he talks about buying boring food so that your friends don't eat it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66OQ-GPYfCE).

My favorite Kool Keith album is [Dr. Dooom - First Come First Served](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Come,_First_Served) because everything about it is so absurd. If people can make gangsta rap albums where the stories are obviously not real, why not go completely over the top and be a cannibalistic serial killer who pushes body parts in shopping carts?

I bought that album on vinyl when it was new in 1999, recently there was a [25th anniversary reissue](https://www.turntablelab.com/products/dr-dooom-first-come-first-served-25th-anniversary-colored-vinyl-vinyl-2lp) that came out and it made me feel so old. Also, $70?! Get outta here.
