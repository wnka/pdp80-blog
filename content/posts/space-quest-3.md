I played a lot of Sierra 'Quest' games when I was a kid. To prove this statement, here's a picture of me wearing the glasses that came with [Space Quest 3](https://www.spacequest.net/sq3/).

Good news! You can download the template for these from [SpaceQuest.net](https://www.spacequest.net/misc/goodies/snout2.pdf). I might have to make some for my daughter...
