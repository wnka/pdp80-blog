**Life.**
- Physical, COVID booster, feeling blah

**Biking.** 
- [Bartosz Ciechanowski - Bicycles](https://ciechanow.ski/bicycle/) - This is an amazing website. What a cool way to explain the physics of bicycling. I'm not going to lie, I did *not* read the whole thing, but I played with the animations and read some spots and learned things. This whole page is ~3MB, which is pretty amazing given how much animation and interactivity there is. I randomly looked at CNN's website (well not randomly, I knew it would be bloated) and it was 25MB.
- The term "acoustic" bike.

**Gaming.**
- Street Fighter 2 oral history
 - bit about rainbow edition being dismissed then the speed being recognized
 - links to other read only memory books
- Resident Evil 4
 - Haven't had much time to play, been mostly playing on Steam Deck.
 - First impressions. It's good. I feel like the original did a much better job of capturing tension when it was you up a bunch of villagers. I think the laser sight thing had something to do with it.

**Music.**
- That harp lady
- Crash course in science = Raiden Fighters.
