In February 2019, I biked **16.3 miles**. Quite the drop from January! What the hell happened? 2 things:

* Weather in Seattle has been **cold** and really not nice for biking. There was the biggest snow storm I've ever experienced since moving here in 2006!
* I got called for jury duty and ended up serving on a jury for about 4 weeks. It was a [pretty crazy case](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/murder-charge-filed-after-body-found-in-shopping-cart/) and riding my bike to the courthouse while serving wasn't really an option.

So far in March, I've biked **36.4 miles**. February put a pretty big dent in my habit. The weather is getting a lot nicer here though so I'll get back out there.
