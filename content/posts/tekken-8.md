This is so great and fun. [Brian Cox breaks down the storyline of Tekken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRIOVeirAa0).

I had no idea the story was so over the top! I had no interest in Tekken 8 but now I might buy it. [The endings for Tekken 1 are hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvaB8XK-89w), and now I know why that one guy threw that other guy off a cliff, and that throwing people off cliffs is a thing.
