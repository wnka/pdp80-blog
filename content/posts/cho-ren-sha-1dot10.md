Happy New Year! Surprise shmup release! [Cho Ren Sha 68k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Ren_Sha_68K), a game originally released in 1995 for the Sharp X68000 Computer, has been updated to version 1.10. 30th anniversary update?! 

[It's FREE and available here](https://yosshin4004.github.io/x68k/crs68k/official/index.html) for both Windows and X68000. 

I took it for a spin and was able to reach stage 2-0 on my first attempt. I made it all the way to 1-6 without dying but then my run fell apart. Such a fun game! I'm not sure what all is different, but the graphics and backgrounds have been updated. The *fantastic* music remains the same. [I wrote more about the game when I cleared the first loop back in 2022.]({{<ref cho-ren-sha-1all>}})

Absolutely worth a download and a play!
