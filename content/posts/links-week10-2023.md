# Music

- [DE LA SOUL Paying Homage To David 'Trugoy' Jolicoeur & Speaks on Their Catalogue Finally Streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V46EiHI-TdU) - Classic De La Soul albums are finally on streaming platforms. This is a rare proper use of "FINALLY". One of their members passed away recently, Dave aka Plug Two aka Trugoy the Dove which is sad. This interview with the two remaining members is great, and the part 14 minutes in where they both remember and perform one of Dave's early rhymes was really touching and sweet.

# Computer Stuff

- [Evans & Sutherland CT5 Flight Simulator (1981)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W-qb_jHRhA) - Early 1981 professional level flight sim. For 1981 that's amazing. Some details about the system are [here](https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/ct5-evans-sutherland-simulator-how-did-it-work.57664/). 

# Misc

- [The Dollop #9 - The Pendragon of Marin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Ape0zUnT4&t=455s) - ... or how I learned to stop worrying and love a laser on top of Mt. Tam.
