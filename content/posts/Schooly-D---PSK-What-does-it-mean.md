I was in a meeting at work the other day reading a document (it’s AWS, we have meetings where the first X minutes are spent in silence reading a doc) and the term “PSK” was used with no definition so my brain had to think about it for a second.

The answer was “Pre Shared Key” which made sense it the context of the doc. 

But the other option in my brain was the classic [Schooly D song “P.S.K. (What does it mean?)”](https://youtu.be/m1mn9m_1h5U?si=eNjEZ1dZgyvUjlDC). That song rules and if you don’t know it you should. It’s also great for testing the bass capabilities of your audio system.
