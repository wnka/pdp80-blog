I love this game.

The first time I ever played
[Muchi Muchi Pork](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/muchimuchipork/muchimuchipork.htm) was at a
shmupmeet here in Seattle back in November 2010 at the old Pink Gorilla arcade. There's a collector
here in Seattle who owns a lot of Cave PCBs and the operator (who's now the operator of
[Full Tilt in Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5)) would borrow stuff
from him for our meets. This is before all the XBox 360 ports so it was pretty special to be able to
play Cave STGs outside of Japan.

That meet was pretty epic, the lineup was
[Pink Sweets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Sweets:_Ibara_Sorekara),
[Dodonpachi Daifukkatsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-Don-Pachi_Dai-Fukkatsu),
[Progear](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/progear/progear.htm), and
[Muchi Muchi Pork](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/muchimuchipork/muchimuchipork.htm).

You can see Muchi Muchi Pork on the cab at the end, which is actually the Astro City I ended up buying
from that operator! [I fixed the marquee lamp...]({{< ref "marquee-light-replacement.md">}})

No one at the meet knew how to play Muchi Muchi Pork, I played it and didn't really think much of
it. I felt the same way about Pink Sweets. We spent most of the meet playing Daifukkatsu because we
all were familiar with the other Dodonpachi games and their scoring systems.

Even still, I bought the XBox 360 port that bundled Muchi Muchi Pork and Pink Sweets because I
figured that at least one of the games would be enjoyable once I knew how to play them. I played
Muchi Muchi Pork first, and still haven't really touched Pink Sweets because Muchi Muchi Pork is *SO
FUN*.

_YES_, the character design makes you look like a pervert.  _YES_, the in game character voices can
be annoying. But blowing shit up and creating massive amounts of 10,000 medals and them vacuuming
them up is *AWESOME*.

Ports are great, but I'm weird and need to own the original so as a reward to myself for all my hard
work at my job for the last 6 months I picked up the PCB. I ordered it from [Sophia Corp](http://www.sophia-corp.jp/) who I highly
recommend. Great service, decent prices, and they know how to pack and ship PCBs.

As usual, I can let ["STGWeekly"](http://twitter.com/stgweekly) provide a great intro to the game:

The guest and player in that episode is NTSC-J, who lives in Japan but is from Seattle. He was back
in town once and came out to Full Tilt and I got to meet him, really nice guy. He mentions our
["ice cream bar"](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5) at the
[end of that episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOEQKFTxf5A#t=5205) which is pretty cool.

I did some streaming on Twitch from the PCB this morning and had a good run, which is my personal
best!

One of my shmup goals for 2014: 1-ALL Muchi Muchi Pork!
