I looked at a list of Grammy Award 2024 winners and saw that Burning Spear was nominated for 'Best Reggae Album' which blew my mind. 

**Burning Spear is still alive!?!?!?**

[Thanks to his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Spear) I've now learned that he's 78 years old. I don't know a ton of his music, but I have a bootleg/reissue of his first album which is *insanely good*. That first album is from 1973 and he's only 28! That voice is coming out of a 28 year old?! It sounds like he was 78 back in 1973, which if true would make him 129 in 2024. Hence my surprise.

That album is not on streaming services, [but thankfully someone put it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arvwRBPaQes)

I have strong memories of buying that album, because I went to the [record store](https://blackandread.com) to kill time before meeting my new girlfriend's family for the first time. This was in 2005 and that girlfriend is now my wife.

I can remember the other records I bought on that trip:
- [Ray Barretto - Acid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXR7Rpo6rNI&list=PL0LeaI4W7Oc_PgX4msr3FYqCxrT_4wuHs&index=4)
- [Horace Andy - Dance Hall Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMLHsJjAQHc)
- [The Electric Prunes - S/T](https://youtu.be/jg_4Yz-wV70?t=962)

I often remember what albums I bought with other albums, which is not a very valuable skill.
