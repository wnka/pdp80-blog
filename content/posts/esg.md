You've likely heard this song, it's been sampled by a lot of hip-hop tracks. The group is [ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG_(band)), and the song is [UFO from their first EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG_(EP)).

[The original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAH9yD4Sxqo) - you listen to it and it doesn't sound like anything that exceptional. 

Now, that EP was originally issued on a 45 RPM vinyl record. If you take that song and play it at 33 RPM, which will *slow it down*, you get something that sounds craaaaazy!

[Slowed down to 33 RPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFF0AKMhrxw) - This is what has been sampled a ton. Wikipedia says over 500 songs.

Some favorites that sample it:
1. [Big Daddy Kane - Ain't no Half Steppin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVCxbzPmOQQ) - I mean, this song is amazing. One of my favorite rap songs of all time.
2. [Stezo - It's my turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKuK45t-sEY) - I think this dude was a dancer for EPMD or something? Another classic, also samples [Atomic Dog - George Clinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuyS9M8T03A) and I also think this was the first use of the famous [Skull Snaps - It's a New Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiqO3fB4I78) drum break.
3. [Public Enemy - Night of the Living Baseheads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GbDYeKVZA) - A short use at about 2:10.
4. [J Dilla - Geek Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70SwRaTFgHM) - It's JD so of course he chops it up and makes it unique.

Another fun fact: The producer of the EP is [Martin Hannett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hannett) who you might know from producing Joy Division and New Order albums.

As far as other ESG songs go, [Moody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6VKgfwqnOY) is my favorite. The trailer for Sofia Coppola's [Priscilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBWk6BohVXk) used ESG's [My Love for You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocLiOg5lvJQ) which is also a pretty rad song.
