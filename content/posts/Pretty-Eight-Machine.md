[This album remakes Pretty Hate Machine using 8-bit computers and consoles.](https://inversephase.bandcamp.com/album/pretty-eight-machine-se) “Head Like I/O”? That’s rad!

Pretty Hate Machine was a little before my time. When I was a depressed teenager in high school I did listen to a lot of Downward Spiral though.
