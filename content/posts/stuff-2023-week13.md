# Biking

- [Bartosz Ciechanowski - Bicycles](https://ciechanow.ski/bicycle/) - This is an amazing website. What a cool way to explain the physics of bicycling. I'm not going to lie, I did *not* read the whole thing, but I played with the animations and read some spots and even then I learned something. This whole page is ~3MB, which is pretty amazing given how much animation and interactivity there is. I randomly looked at CNN's website (well not randomly, I knew it would be bloated) and it was 25MB.
