After I 1CC'd [Mushihimesama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama) Maniac mode, I didn't play the game much. I let a friend borrow it for a while, then I let the operator at [Full Tilt Ice Cream in Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5) borrow it and put it on location. We recently took it out to install my [Gunbird 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbird_2) PCB, but before it left I spent a bunch of time and was able to 1CC both Original mode and Maniac mode on location.

I was able to greatly improve my Original mode score by beating the game with more lives in stock.

My Maniac mode score isn't my best 1CC score, but doing it on location was pretty satisfying.

On to [Gunbird 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbird_2)!
