I added a PayPal donate button to the Gawker website so you may now commence with the giving of money to me.  Feel free to donate as much (or as little) as you would like.  Or donate nothing.  It's all up to you.





I hadn't thought of doing this before, but a Gawker user (fan?) suggested I do it, so it's done.  Of course, don't feel obligated to donate anything, but if you use Gawker and enjoy it, make a donation!





Thanks!
