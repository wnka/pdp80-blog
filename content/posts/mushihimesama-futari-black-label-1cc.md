After my 1CC of Version 1.5 Original mode, I figured that I'd also be able to 1CC of Black Label Original mode. It took a few tries but I was able to pull it off!

**Character:** Palm **Final score:** 293,899,502

The Black Label version of the game (which is available on the 360 as DLC) has some [tweaks to the scoring system and shot types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama_Futari#Arcade_Black_Label_Release), making the potential scores a lot higher. My score is not that great, but I was playing for survival and for that I would say that it's an easier 1CC that 1.5 Original mode.

Next I might try to get my score up. That's what I love about shooting games, you can always try to make that number go up!
