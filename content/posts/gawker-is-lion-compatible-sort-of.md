Lion was released today and I upgraded my Mac.  I did a little testing of Gawker to make sure it still works, and I was glad to see that it does in fact still work for capturing from a camera.

However, I noticed that capturing from the desktop doesn't seem to work.  I'll investigate what is wrong when I get some time.
