Even though I got [new PCBs in June](/blog/2011/06/new-pcbs/), I previously had set a "1CC [Ketsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui) in June" goal for myself so I didn't spend much time with them.  June is over, so did I meet my goal?  Unfortunately, no.  I got very close and I'll continue the chase soon, but I had to take a break.  I didn't touch shmups for about a week or so.  

I had played a few credits of Mushihimesama and gotten a feel for the different modes. I found Original mode to be pretty easy, in fact the first time I ever played the game I was able to get to stage 4 on one credit and soon after was reaching stage 5.  But again, due to my prior commitment I didn't put much time into it.

Tonight I decided to ease myself back into playing and threw Mushihimesama in the Astro City.  On about the 4th credit of Original mode I played, I was able to pull off the 1CC!
