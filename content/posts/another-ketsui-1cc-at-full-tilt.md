I 1CC'd [Ketsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui:_Kizuna_Jigoku_Tachi) again at [Full Tilt](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5), this time with the Wide Shot ship (Tiger Schwert) which is my first ever with that ship type. I had to tweak my strategies a little since this ship moves slower than the other ship type, but I found it's faster lock on speed and wider shot to be pretty helpful in dealing with stage 5 where there are a lot of popcorn enemies all over the screen. Stage 5 is always a pain though, to me Ketsui has two parts: everything leading up to stage 5, then stage 5.

I was at Full Tilt with my wife and she recorded the end of the run... I didn't even have to ask, she knows what's up!

That's my best 1cc score evar! I'm going to be playing more with that shot type and aim for getting to the second loop. I think with a little practice I could reach the easier 2nd loop...
