In July 2018, I rode only **19 miles**, making it the lowest mileage month yet of 2018. I did ride quite a bit on [LimeBike e-bikes](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/rode-electric-limebike-around-downtown-seattle-hill-lived-tell-tale/), which are electric pedal-assist bikes you can use to get around Seattle. I rode those to and from work quite a bit, for a total of about **27 pedal-assist miles** but I'm not counting that towards my overall milage. Pedal-assist makes it super easy to get up hills so it's hardly a workout, but it was a good way to ease back into biking while my back got better. My back is doing much better these days and I've started riding more, so I hope to rack up more miles in August!

2018 total miles: **623**
