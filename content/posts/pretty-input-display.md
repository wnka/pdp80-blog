I made visual improvements to my arcade input display which can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/wnka/arcadebuttons-node-pi). The display is pure CSS and was heavily influenced by this [CSS Joystick project](https://github.com/davidvandusen/joystick).

{{< figure src="/images/buttonslocal.jpg" alt="The old style" caption="BEFORE: The old style">}}

{{< figure src="/images/pretty-input.jpg" alt="The new style" caption="AFTER: The new style">}}

I styled it after the control panel on my Astro City cabinet, which explains the green and the button layout.

You can see it in action here, where I played some Espgaluda and got a new personal best 1cc clear score of **28,582,720**!
