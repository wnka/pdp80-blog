I've had a goal of breaking a billion points on Mushihimesama Futari Black Label God Mode for a while now, and with a little effort I was able to get a score of 1,212,620,114!

My run started really strong, I almost had a billion points at the end of stage 2. Stage 3 was a big mess but I was able to push to a new personal best. If I get some more time to play I should be able to crank that number up, so my next goal is 1.5 billion.
