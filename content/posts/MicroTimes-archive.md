Someone put a bunch of issues of [MicroTimes on archive.org](https://oldbytes.space/@PlayHistory/112995235116115586) which is super cool. I used to get this free magazine when going to Fry’s Electronics in the SF Bay Area when I was a kid. Looking through an old issue brought back a lot of memories. We bought a 386DX-25 from Hi-Q in Sunnyvale in probably ‘89, years later I used to salivate over 486DX2-66 machines in all those ads…
