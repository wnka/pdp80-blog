Unfortunately, I did not meet my biking goal of 1,500 miles for 2015. 

I went 1,379 miles total in 2015. 

I injured my back in late October which made me unable to bike. I was able to get back in the saddle in late December and ride about 40 more miles before heading out for Christmas vacation in Colorado to visit our families. 

I've had back problems for years but after going to physical therapy for this most recent flare up, I've got a good set of stretches and exercises that should help me prevent future issues.

I'll be setting a new goal for 2016 and working to maintain my back so that I don't get sidelined again!
