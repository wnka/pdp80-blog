AWS Lambda has turned 10 years old!

There was a 10 year celebration livestream that I participated with a great panel of folks. It was a lot of fun and is [available here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJaJk9I94Kk).

I joined Lambda in 2016 about 2 years after it launched and got to work on interesting things like migrating the compute platform onto [Firecracker](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/agache), delivering a good customer experience around using the [OCI Container Packaging format](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc23/presentation/brooker), and improving cold-start times with [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html).

I've always liked focusing on what I call "lifestyle problems", meaning these are things that are always going to need improving and work. Customers are always going to want lower cold-start times and better availability. We as a business are always going to want to drive better efficiency and scale. These aren't the only things I work on, but it's what I enjoy the most because it causes you to deeply understand your systems.

I'm proud of the work I've done and the impact Lambda has had on cloud computing. My 8 years on Lambda have been the most satisfying of my career and I'm excited about the things we're working on next!
