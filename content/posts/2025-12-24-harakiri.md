I recently watched the movie [Harakiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harakiri_(1962_film)) and it's now one of my favorite movies. I loved everything about it, the way it unfolds, the acting, the way it's shot, and that it's very hard to tell where it's going. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it.

The Japanese actor who played the main character, [Tatsuya Nakadai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuya_Nakadai), passed away recently on November 8 2025.

I didn't realize as I was watching Harakiri that he's been in a bunch of other movies like Yojimbo and Sanjiro, mostly because in those movies he's clean shaven. But most importantly I didn't realize he played the old lord in [Ran (1985)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_(film)) which was hard to tell because, you know, aging. But the eyes make it obvious.

Ran is another favorite of mine because it just looks amazing. I've watched it many times with the sound off while I work.

Now I want to watch more movies he's been in because he's a fantastic actor. I bought a Blu-Ray of [The Human Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(film_series)), which is 3 parts and is a total of... 579 minutes?! Well the holiday break is coming up. That is directed by the same director as Harakiri, ([Masaki Kobayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Kobayashi)) so I'm sure it's great.
