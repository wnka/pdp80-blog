We spent Thanksgiving day at Disneyland and it was magical! We loved watching our daughter getting her mind blown over and over and seeing the joy on her face.
 
We got to have a nice Thanksgiving meal of churros, cotton candy, and popcorn. There was a nice holiday parade and we got to see Elsa and Anna in person! Rides ridden:

1. Peter Pan
1. Alice in Wonderland
1. Jungle Cruise
1. Chip and Dale Rollercoaster
1. The Matterhorn

We pressed our luck with the Matterhorn and it was a little scary for the kiddo. We didn't know the beginning of the ride was pitch black which she didn't like and the yeti with the red eyes scared her a little, but she liked splashing through the water at the end.

I'm not sure this is a family tradition yet but we'll definitely be going back!
