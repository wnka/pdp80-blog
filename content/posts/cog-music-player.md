[I wrote before](/posts/video-game-music/) how I like to listen to video game music. I found a great app called [Cog in the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cog-kode54/id1630499622?mt=12) that handles that really well.

The main thing I didn't like about the command-line tool I was using was that if I changed outputs (from headphones to speakers or whatever) it wouldn't honor it and would keep playing through the output used when you started the app. Cog handles that perfectly.

Plus it's free!
