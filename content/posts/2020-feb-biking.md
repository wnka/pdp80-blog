In February I biked **214 miles** for a total of 523 miles in 2020 so far. This was pretty much all commuting to work with a few Peloton rides sprinkled in. I biked to work every day except *three* which I'm pretty proud of!

~500 miles in two months puts me on track for 3,000 miles in twelve months. Just gotta keep it up!
