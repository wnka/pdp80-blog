I moved my blog from Octopress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) since it builds sites blazing fast and doesn't have all the goofy dependency management of Ruby with rvm and all that. I picked a nice super simple [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/temple/) that builds fast loading pages.

I'm considering blogging more in 2018. I haven't been playing a lot of shmups lately but have been biking quite a bit. It's the primary way I get to work these days and I really have grown to enjoy it, even in the Seattle rain!
