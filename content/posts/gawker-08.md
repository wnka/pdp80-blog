Gawker 0.8 has been released.  New stuff includes scheduling recordings, ability to password protect shared cameras, improved timestamp appearance and user interface improvements.  A lot of little things in this one, mainly having to do with the interface and making things a little more friendly.  I'm not really much of a GUI designer so it was fun to sit down and think how things should be done. Lots of trial and error but it lead to some additional Cocoa knowledge which is a good thing.  I'd appreciate any feedback as to things I'm doing wrong/right.





I decided to move the development blog onto wordpress since iWeb really wasn't cuttin it on that front.  I'm glad to finally have comments.
