I've moved my site off of [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) and onto
[Amazon S3's static webhosting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
I get no traffic, so Dreamhost was overkill.  I experimented with S3 static hosting when I made
[Northwest STG](http://nwstg.com) and found it work well and cost virtually nothing, so I
have transitioned my site over. This site is now built with
[Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) with the ["Octopress Flat" theme](https://github.com/alexharris/octopress-flat/).

I've also moved the main domain to be [fishandbeef.com](http://fishandbeef.com) from
[wnka.org](http://wnka.org).  Fish and Beef is what cats crave!
