[This is some rough animation footage from the Akira anime movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxt0TygJdwI). From [here](https://exploringakira.wordpress.com/tag/katsuhiro-otomo/):

> One of the most notable tools used in the production of the film was the use of the Quick Action Recorder. The quick action recorder allowed the animators to take pictures of individual frames (like a down-shooter) and replay the frames at 24fps (frames per second). This technique was extremely helpful in correction and timing for the film, giving the staff a way to observe their work before moving onto cells.

Even though it's black and white and rough, it gives such a striking impression of how much *work* went into the animation.
