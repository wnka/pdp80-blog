This is a page listing what I'm up to and my priorities, kind of like old .plan files. Remember .plan files?

1. Getting ready for our first child, a baby girl who is due in late October! Right now this mostly means getting rid of stuff we don't need to free up space in our house. Also taking a parenting/birthing class.
1. Being a software engineer on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I've been focused on distributed systems stuff for a while, starting to dig a little more into Linux internals to help understand resource wastage. I've been playing around a little with [eBPF](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html) in my spare time which is super neat.
1. Cycling! My current goal is to bike to work at least 3 days a week, and then do a longer ride on the weekend. The longest I've biked is a [100km](/posts/metric-century-ride/) and my goal is to do a 100 mile ride before baby arrives.
1. Reading! I'm currently reading [A Gentleman in Moscow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow) and [How Apollo Flew to the Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2323178.How_Apollo_Flew_to_the_Moon).
1. I'm playing [Espgaluda](http://www.world-of-arcades.net/Cave/Espgaluda/Espgaluda.htm) and trying to get my [1cc score](/posts/espgaluda-1cc-27mil/) above 30 million.

# Trying to avoid

1. Phone time. I no longer keep my phone next to my bed.
1. Excessive twitch.tv watching. There's always something on!

# Up next?

1. Thinning down my arcade stuff. Maybe take some stuff to work?
