This is inspired by [the Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about), I will keep this page up to date with what I'm currently focused on and doing.

# Focused on now

1. Getting ready for our first child, a baby girl who is due in late October!
1. Being a software engineer on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
1. Cycling! My current goal is to bike to work at least 3 days a week, and then do a longer ride on the weekend. The longest I've biked is a [100km](/posts/metric-century-ride/) and my goal is to do a 100 mile ride before baby arrives.
1. I'm playing [Espgaluda](http://www.world-of-arcades.net/Cave/Espgaluda/Espgaluda.htm) and trying to get my [1cc score](/posts/espgaluda-1cc-27mil/) above 30 million.
