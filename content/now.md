This is inspired by [the Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about), I will keep this page up to date with what I'm currently focused on and doing.

# Focused on now

1. Getting ready for our first child, a baby girl who is due in late October!
1. Being a software engineer on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I've been focused on distributed systems stuff for a while, starting to dig a little more into Linux internals to help understand resource wastage. I've been playing around a little with [eBPF](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html) in my spare time which is super neat.
1. Cycling! My current goal is to bike to work at least 3 days a week, and then do a longer ride on the weekend. The longest I've biked is a [100km](/posts/metric-century-ride/) and my goal is to do a 100 mile ride before baby arrives.
1. I'm playing [Espgaluda](http://www.world-of-arcades.net/Cave/Espgaluda/Espgaluda.htm) and trying to get my [1cc score](/posts/espgaluda-1cc-27mil/) above 30 million.

# Trying to avoid

1. Phone time. I no longer keep my phone next to my bed.
1. Excessive twitch.tv watching. There's always something on!

# Up next?

1. Less stuff! With a baby on the way, we need to get rid of stuff we no longer use to make room. This will be a gradual thing.
