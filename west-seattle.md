I rode out to West Seattle today, which was surprisingly easy. The statement "I'm going to bike to West Seattle" sounds quite gutsy, but it's really not that far! I biked to Marination and my wife drove out there and we had lunch together, then I biked home the longer way by going between Magnolia and Queen Anne.

I headed out by going south on 10th Ave/Broadway through Capitol Hill, which at some point gains a nice separated bike lane which I appreciated. I hit Yesler Way and headed into downtown and met up with the Elliot Bay trail. I got a tiny bit lost on the way, going through the bike lane on 2nd Ave which was packed with homeless people hanging out. I certainly felt out of place...

Once on Elliot Bay trail it was easy to follow the signage and reach Alki Beach. Things were pretty flat and easy. My wife met me and we had lunch, then I headed back. I went home a longer way, which was fairly straightforward but had one sketchy part when I had to bike with traffic along the Seattle waterfront. This didn't last long though and soon I was back on a trail near the Seattle Sculpture Park. 

Total distance: **24.8 miles**
